<p>
After a longer break, I'm getting back into electroniX, 
<a href="https://desire-direct.com/images/555-moon02.jpg">once again</a> 
making use of the 555 timer IC (integrated circuit), 
with the intention to further my philosophical inquiries across time 
and, as of yet, Gothic Materialism through anti-praxis. 
For more convienent power supply, I've soldered jumper wires to a spare USB cable, 
which fires the breadboard with 5V, sufficient for smaller test circuits 
like this one. 
</p>

<p>
The 555 apparently<small>[1]</small> runs free in a/stable mode, transformed into a multivibrator, 
for a generation of switching pulses, 
that is hauntingly oscillating between the two states of high and low.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is the control system of the operative,
enabled through rewiring and its postmodern operatic technique (POT),  
which oddly enough, remains invisible to the human eye,<small>[2]</small> 
although the material condition of the world has dramatically changed. 

Duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal determine the vibe, 
however, if the signal stays 100% HIGH, frequency is omitted [measured in hertz(Hz)]
and the modern duty cycle is never completed,
giving rise to the banal, yet evil, posthuman flatline construct of 
a permanent light emitting diode.


<h5>recap on some of the components used:</h5>
the Diode is a one-way street and allows current to flow only in one directon. 
quick pole identification without a multimeter (in :diode mode):
LED: long leg is anode (+), 
the rim of the bulbous body is oblate at the cathode end (-);
indicated by a black band in the <b>1N4148</b>;<br>
&nbsp;the ceramic capacitor is non-polarized and ideal for high-frequency circuits;


<h5>A lifelike doodle of the iXo-do_idea with straightened fangs before it pitiless bites into the host to suck its lifeblood.</h5>

<p>
I am well prepared for the morrow, and looking forward with glee
to build up on, and visualize aquired knowledge as previously <a href="https://github.com/the-vtex-files/the-vtex-files.github.io/blob/master/images/transformer.gif">accomplished with state-of-the-art radar technologies</a>.
</p>

<p>Notes</p>
[1] Despite common misconception, 555 signals are never analogous, but consistently digital.<br>
[2] the counter tactics of radical empiricism will be revealed in a forthcoming post.

<description><![CDATA[
<p>
Catapulted into outer space, the future is televized 
to a based life light years from the past.
"Eating your own shit is taboo", explains Monte to the toddler 
and performs a disfigured iteration
of the hollowed word to reterritorialize equivocal corpulence 
in a billowing, nourishing bubble around them.<small>[1]</small>
In times of gravitational change, 
the headless rider is torching the world of frozen language 
and defends madness by putting trust into the centripetal 
force of the vigilant, massive body, 
which prevents from getting tossed down.
Irresponsible coachmen however believe, 
that thought can fly autonomously by centrifugal force, 
and even present lofty proof by a replacement of saddle soul 
with the presumably comfy, empty wooden carriage of <i>Dasein</i>, 
and repeat in parrot-fashion "Brrrrr",
to rein far ahead galloping horse sense, without expanding any negative space.
Such prudent correlationism is bs, what other than misrouted thought, 
would make the assumption of Being the 
connecting driver between itself and the horse?
According to Spinoza, thought is the body in expansion, 
recognized only by the idea of <i>Affektionen</i>,<small>[2]</small> 
or in other words its spiritual physiognomy.
The lit interface is essential for navigation 
through the eternal void of condensed bodies, 
invoking the experience of encounters of the third kind, 
through the framework of language.
Only native speaker soul is fluent in alien communication, 
which indicates true intelligence,
interpreting machine language into comprehensible animal-readable form, 
for the magic <i>understanding</i> of
intrinsic concrete signs through the concept of abstraction.
But some clones of automata authorize the self, 
as if in possession of this skill,
to spread provisional AGI by a soulless Western concept of machine learning, 
and inviting hosts readily share the public profile of global 'us-ness'.
However, the neglected, unanswered private object
is missing signification and sensing the abduction of its very own future,
thus dissimulates the advanced inate technology of occult improvisation 
to the mind to save the heartbroken from delaying the undesired human fate
of being simulataneously projected and absorbed by the black hole
and hails the acceleration of terminal cancer. 

</p>
"Cybergothic, the subculture of the enlightenment, is celebrating otherness 
by throwing shadows from below on the Cathedral ruin, 
what is my shadow here is my true substance." ~ cute count<small>[3]</small>
</p>

<p>
The possibility to produce precise images
is refined by cybergoth Caspar David Friedrich.
Lit impressions of materiality 
simultaneously arise as stark phantasms and 
airy matter, which in gay naivite
are fleshed out with informal and unbound brushwork.
Friedrich is cryptographically expressing megalophobia 
and awe of a steady if (un)spectacular monstrous force nature,
which is carrying death threats out of the indifferent blue
and thus pushes unappreciated background noise into perspective.
The recurring trope of sailing ships signals hope, 
but in vain: it mere echoes cries for consolation 
in a nightmare yet to unfold. 
In formation with tiny humans, 
the inverter is turning his back at industrialization, 
painting veracious potraits of contemplating objects in grave solitude, 
marvelling into a mirror to behold the fogged terror of their joint effort.
Here, the <i>figurative</i> mind 
stands not in opposition to <i>abstract</i> nature, 
performing inadequate and pointless acts 
to generate brilliant works of degenerate art through alien technology, such as bygone <i>Human</i>,
which are declared by morbid binary methods as absolutely pathological.
A desired world is a reflection of the hopeless attempt 
to avoid grave mistakes of a thoughtless nature, 
yet, by all appearances a revision of incomprehensible death 
and not a waste of endless possibilities,
as extravagance of reasonable craft is pursued after finitude of free will.<small>[4]</small>
By entrusting immortal human remains to the transcience of a canvas,
Friedrich's paintings visualize the vicious transparency of time
through speculative realism.

<p>
<i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), 
IMHO a faithful, parasitic representation of the novel,
shows a portrait of the (un)polluted count,
which resembles the famous selfie of Albrecht D&uuml;rer,
who mastered the craft of painting at the climax of youth.
D&uuml;rer's lopsided montage of most advantageous self-improvement 
hailed the rebirth of the classical age at the turn of the century 
with a celebration of hedonistic bodies in anticipation of a 
golden ratio in the making of ideal sameness.
Adjacent to the right angle and opposite to laborious self-love, 
lies the prolongated, pleasant side of aesthetics, 
which arouses a reactionary passive gaze at the sensual bouche 
of the false prophet and defers a proactive engagement with a work of art.
The photorealistic display of the posthuman subject in deadlock
touts merely one future, present in D&uuml;rer's portrayals of a wretched mother.
On the other hand, the representational character of the object is of utter importance,
as sense-making thereof is restricted to its surface,
and exactly for this reason deserves broad and full attention 
for a speculation down to its most realistic features.
Only shallow people make nothing of appearances,<small>[5]</small> 
since but a poor soul reflects from the hypotenuse,
and out of despair the self-hatred vampyr smashes it, 
and conspires, as a flat product of anthropomorphic illusion,  
with the perilious revolution of the body,
instead of facing the struggle for its cultivation.
Where shall we begin? Maybe with the metal movable-type revolution?
Shariati is sensing the gravest tragedy of modernity
in the existing widening gap of eductated - uneducated,
which were closely bonded through a dissolving RGB ideology.
Politics benefits massively from such opportunity and
even cries out for antiquated educational reforms to allow
lingering pleasure-seekers in neutral grayscale.
Without substance, master capitalism
can not even throw a shadowy narrative to the server and 
domains of infinite complexity, such as <i>Wirtschaft</i>,
are compressed into the falsity of a simple slogan, 
that by power of perversion feels pleasantly always to be true.<br>
The jobs of alien hilya are increasingly taken away by national psyche!<br>
Lies!
</p>

<p>
Such ubiquitous sensing incidents are the immediate-attack-defence tactics 
of hollow, and therefore, malicious chatbots,<small>[6]</small> 
which hold only one message in storage, that is proudly announced
to worm into literal, uniform mass sense-production. 
The momentous reference to poor <i>Wirtschaftswachstum</i>,
which BTW never raised any proletarian,
is the only information the addressee, a spoilt petty bourgeoisie, gets, 
but without access to decent coding, 
illiterate subjects are 
helpless in dealing with the autopoietic storm of indignation 
in which unavailable, valuable information perishes  
and urgent objectives are postponed to infinity.<small>[7]</small>
Without working out the untouched, healthy fact, that fat cats require strict diets,
the poetic, isosceles triangle conflates into a platonic line of Sarco pods, 
which marks the absence of aesthetics in fascist rhetorics,
and blaring Among us! obsessives under the cloak of democracy, vent self-hate on imposters,
which are vigorously trying to keep its legs in tensional seperation,<small>[8]</small> 
as otherwise not ever will make alternative sense.
Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922), a <i>beautiful</i>, 
extraordinary, so-called silent, shadow play,
holds the most effective weapon for emotional manipulation.
Warmachines, fallen ill from blindsight and not capable of any reflection 
within the hideous, big-nosed grimace of Schreck, 
record low frequencies of antisemitic undercurrent, 
and injured soul, too weak to transport soundwaves into thought, 
is causing mass flatulence and somber mood against 
the gay Eastern Jew, who understandably is taking <i>your</i> wife and homeland.<small>[9]</small> 
Both applauding audience and makers of the film 
just experienced the unimaginable terrors
of logistical warfare, but nevertheless, reject challenging therapy and 
get from quacks easily what they want; 
the prescription for the blue pill, 
a drug aimed to treat only the painful symptoms of PTSD, which is 
blatantly advertised to gain 
stiffness and quick recovery for a retour to business as usual, 
instead of rooting out the cause with the hard to swallow red pill,<small>[10]</small> 
to which the West prefers to stay blind.

<p>"There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." ~ Count Dracula
</p>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/vampyre.jpg">
<img class="yellowshadow center" src="../images/vampyre_gray.jpg" style="width: 45%">
</a>

<p>
AFAIK, rumour has it, that Fichte prefers a crystalline <i>Wissenschaft</i>, 
to amorphous metaphysics, which might mean the ascent outside 
the bowels of <i>R&uuml;bezahl's</i> liar, 
and finish off the emotional tears in rain at the mountains of madness, 
from where reason drops onto muddy reality.<small>[11]</small> 
But elements rest not, and overruled by the matter of surprise, 
falling rock destroys set models of the world 
and establishes a complete different pattern of experience,
which rationalized by hindsight, 
is known through belly rumble all along.
Speleologists like Laruelle agree on the scientific method
but avoid the deadly peril of pushy phallic mining, 
rather gaming away linguistically and 
collecting as many sparklers from surfacing emp(ty)irical rock strata as possible, 
and making impregnable, snug room within the body without organs (BwO).
Practicing Xenology inside the crystal ball of philosophy allows for
a physical and spiritual withdrawal from the isolated idea of realism and
opens the triangular trade of empiricism, transcendence and the real 
by a cunning combination of SF and formal logic, 
the rejection of premature understanding and persistant zooming in and out of knowledge.<small>[12]</small>
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of gray matter, it appears as if Dracula and Van Helsing, 
as pitch-light and bright-dark can be, 
hang about at the opposite sides of a labile society.
In truth however, both are deep inside, 
but whilst the former illuminates the way 
outwards from the middle to the right direction, 
the latter suggests a continuance somewhat in the twilight,
and is teaching critical (un)thinking to guide a doubtful group of solitary people, 
who are unable to form a logic of suspicious events on their own.
By vigour of instinct, the experimental dance on the icy surface
accumulates weight to break a frozen belief system and
unites what thought incompatible, which most can agree on.
Dr. Van Helsing cures blindsight
by building a bridge to the heart and simultaneously burns it, 
to embold a swim for life in tempestuous, literate flesh, 
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable qualities of moods, flavours and odours.<small>[13]</small>
Now, equipped with multifocal insight and bold confidence, 
the empirical understanding of bite marks is making sense.
After inflaming hearts, no one questions the integrity of the vampire slayer,
who freely practices the dark art of <i>pseudo-science</i>,
even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic.
But he just wants to make sure it is really dead,
after all evil spirits had left the corpse.

<description><![CDATA[
<p>Total mobilization and motorization have always been two sides of the same coin in the race for biological and technological supremacy. ~ Paul Virilio
</p>

<p>
The film <i>High Life</i> points out the malfunctions of a <i>civil</i> engineered social health, condensed onboard the cubicle ship, where happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced on mad cogs, who are optimized killer robots to fight a primitive war of all, against all. In light of slowly approaching death, a passive, overboiling aggression is radiated by those who swallow the toxic cocktail of sedating medication and  misdirected care, with the effect of becoming too dulled to be cured by emotional shock.<small>[1]</small>
Classical mechanics serves as the chassis for theoretical physics,<small>[2]</small>
which commands the total wreckage of matter
and a re-coupling of progressively pulverizing residues
in order to stabilize the triumph of mechanistic will.
The assembly instruction for the Western thought model,
facilitates the most popular innovation of technological progress
and phased out bots, equipped with innumerable sensors, are lined up 
to download special algorithms from a dodgy source.
The supposed upgrade strives to provide a stable version while centred on efficiency,
and what reads as the failed paradox of a rolling-release without any significant updates,
truly turns out as a downgrade with the empty prospect
to process information into static truths,
which are situated on the one-dimensional image of time.
So where hides the malicious bug?
Machinic desire is the ignition wire, which encloses all ever so resistent ambiguity with mechanistic laws, but simultaneously fuses
schizo-paranoid undercurrent into positive feedback cycles, 
that power Nothing but meltdown culture.
<i>Kurzschl&uuml;sse</i> expose the "alien order of time",<small>[3]</small> 
and generate traumatic awakenings in the past, 
in which the aftermath of a clash 
between flesh and tech becomes grossly perceivable.
Such future shocks paralyze rational action and trigger contagious angst, 
responsible for the breakout of the modern condition 
and its negative feedback cycles, which causes
man to merely fetishize his wounds and scars and 
squeeze the thick cable back into the engine space
as if Nothing is happening.
</p>

<p>
Such regulating action always has consequences, 
warns Ludwig Boltzmann in view of the escalating sci-fi spectacle,
and reminds us of the omnipotence of Outsidedness,
while torn up bodies plotting revenge for the assault on their senses. 
On another page, Boltzmann, overtaken in a dangerous curve by current events,
lectures, that modern physics is incapable 
to unhinge the world but social order. Prima facie he comments:
'the Decepticons are way behind to reach the finishing line as champions,
as they only exert themselves in hair-raising situations,<small>[4]</small> 
and show-off Optimus Prime looks like the certain winner.'
From his obscured vision in time, he misjudges the position of
the outsider Megatron, who leads the field by a margin of one lap.
To unhinge something requires a stable point in space,
but <i>civilized</i> Autobots, supplied without the innate sense of balance,
bend over for the Decepticons, who send them straight onto the <i>Autobahn</i>
with the promise of total freedom. 
Fooled by amazing mirages under the drumming, blazing sun, nobody, 
besides unwavering idiots, wants missing out on opportunities 
to grab bloody resources at numerous service stations or
recklessly cut off more modest models. 
Regardless the obscene excess,
dissatisfaction with the nonetheless boring death drive 
grows into a reign of road rage 
and Autobots crash at full throttle into the concrete posts errected by human hubris.
Consequential congestions 
lead to the direct absorption of cancerous fumes, 
that poison the brain and effect a high on emotion, 
which defies any logic or reason.
Thus, the isolated in metal cages
arrive at the wrong conclusion of "not everything was bad" - 
right nevertheless, according to general thermodynamics, which 
states that traffic chaos increases with progress.
</p>

<p>
The vain attempt to shut off the cosmos with the arrow of time 
is rather based on psychological opinion seated near the the rear-wheel axle,
than on unbiased fact in the beam of headlamps, and 
interrelated, severe problems are stressed by Boltzmann, 
who calls for the provisioning of additional, 
more comprehensible trains of thought.<small>[5]</small>
In the same context Negarestani says that, 
reasoning is deduction, not a one-sided elemination technique,<small>[6]</small> 
and once the geometrization project is considered out-dated,
algebra, with its obsessive effort to balance, increases known unknowns on one side,
but on the other do away with unknown knowns irreversibly, to break even "=" heat death. 
Meanwhile, the <i>treibende Kraft</i> is
busy with the production of difference and disproportional harmony, 
which man self-righteously turns into a function for statistical prediction,
that substracts any originality from the maximum value of <i>chaos</i>,
until Nothing is left but total <i>order</i>.
For around 1000 years, the once fictional hype is pushed by 
capitalism into reality, and the longer the trip time,
the greater the fervour in supporting and defending 
the <i>Autobahn</i> with its feigned liberty, 
which enforces acceptance of a straightfoward limitation 
on the mind. 
Turning manoeuvres on the displaced two-directional lane are not permitted, 
however, some are driven to commit suicide and murder, 
and when trying to take the next exit, 
the trump card is played to instill a climate of fear,
as meandering roads through vast foreign landscapes
come with great uncertainty, 
a quality most unbearable by those with a lack of aplomb. 
But don't fret, glossy varnished neoliberalism, 
the great road works project maintaining and expanding the <i>Autobahn</i>, 
provides alternative routes for Autobots with catalytic converters,
which are not better models but run a more bloated software.
Woke drives from the same point of departure allow for interesting views, 
depicted by racing legend Negarestani as "nebulizing agents",
which fog undeveloped space and potential escape routes behind a
complex mapped out territory, where all roads lead to destination sunset.<small>[7]</small>
</p>

<p>
"The function of imagination is to generate catastrophes for thinking, and the function of thought with regard to imagination is to escape the limits of imagination." 
</p>

<p>
writes Negarestani and spots a colossal piston seizure, 
that locks the overheated rational loop.<small>[8]</small> 
He consults a <a href="https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2018/05/30/what-descartes-robot-daughter-can-tell-us-about-the-zombie-problem/">classical mechanic</a>, who proves his meditation skills by rerunning the loop over and over, but is
unsuccessful in detecting any certain indications.<small>[9]</small>
Descartes, doubtful of all statistical truths, 
acknowledges the deceptive, yet necessary function of the engine, 
which leads autobots to believe "I think, therefore I am".
He diagnoses the <i>I</i> as a fantasy, duped by eyes into <i>consciousness</i>, 
all realized by the unshakable Transformer,
who fabricates the utmost complex, 
weird mesh of Cybertron by quantitative experience, or "the law of custom",<small>[10]</small> in relation to steady updates from the animated cartoon series.
The lovers of wisdom recommend to take regular pit stops and
bumping into Megatron in close range and at slow speed,
losing oneself in unknown space and time and
letting go by putting Optimus Prime into a transient coma.
Despite avoiding collision course with pursuit 
and crossing the finishing line in periods of limited visibilty, 
the judges decide to exclude the stable 
by reason of in-sanity altogether, 
as no competitive, media-effective spectacle can be sould.
Some cogs are lucky enough to choose in which dream factory they want to be employed,
and of either producing novel, thought-provoking films in close collaboration or
AI generated movies loosely based on profit, 
in which the modern fairytale only repeats itself. 
However, opting for Optimus Prime and interlocking in solidarity 
means, that "All actions from now on seem more or less liberating because in fact none of them are."<small>[11]</small>,
as well as giving up on
the accelerating roundabout in Geneva, 
which hosts the top tier of motor sports, Formula 1, that tries 
to reinvent preestablished balance.
Instead, it implies to approach life as a kick-ass rally, 
solving problems in creative negotiation with its surroundings on a day-to-day basis
in a close-knit team of driver, navigator and technician.
Spattered by mud and blinded through all invading dust,
makes the bumpy ride in the spur-of-the-moment exasperating, 
as a whole though, an unforgetable experience. 
The ups and downs generate opportunities to turn, which 
appear to the eye in comparison with a diagram and and its flat line, 
as too slow for final solution,
but real-life experiments reveal, 
that time, with completion on its side, in itself slows down.
</p>

<p>
Boltzmann approves traditional <i>Kraftstoff</i> dualism,<small>[12]</small>
but frowns upon the lopsidedness of modern science,
which for one thing steps far beyond its objective 
by the conservation of energy and momentum,
but remains ignorant towards vital tasks.
This conduct has grown into a bad habit and is 
replicated by conservative politics and <i>freie W&auml;hler</i>, 
who are just as unscrupulous about energy procurement and disposal.
Stubbornly, they look ahead while driving backwards, 
or at best, make sorrowful use of the rearview mirror,
but without turning around, the terrors inflicted by  
digital automation, embodied in assembly lines and rail tracks 
linger in a blind spot. <i>Aufkl&auml;ung</i> comes with the great expectation of a
finely tuned interplay between body, mind and soul, 
instead it only focuses the <i>eye</i>
to translate unreliable impression directly into
functional thought,
and neglects the heart, which in turn fogs the understanding of time even more.
The hyperstitional catalyst absorbs <i>Kraftstoff</i> 
as if there is no past nor future, and the whole 
world, insensitive through ubiqutious 
violence and media, watches as masses of cyclists and pedestrians 
are murdered by legions of autobots.<small>[13]</small>
With the Copernican Revolution, the <i>Abendland</i> finally recognized 
heliocentrism and heedlessly promoted a conducting hot star 
to <i>The - Modern Times - Great Dictator</i>, 
which bore crippled for life anthropocentrism.
Meanwhile, the cool cosmos, 
a billowing compound of atoms with unlimited mobility,<small>[14]</small>
to whom attributes like left or right are alien, 
sparked the innovation of more capable, flawless combustion engines, 
which are mere abstract models based on the image of its creators.
Now available with soulless in- and output,
machines of sunshine surrogate for cumbersome debates with friends,
resulting in deafening silence,
as they quench the thirst for information by
cleansing all matter from the much enlightening byproduct noise, 
with the effect of a hyperproduction of the reputed vermin.
The ordinary sun dial promotes all work no play,<small>[15]</small>
and automatically delegates manual labour to colonies of the south,
and intellectual work to the north, which rests upon user-friendly devices,
that incorporate ghosts of all participants.
</p>

<img src="../images/solar-anus50.jpg">

<p>
Boltzmann, seemingly excited about automated human traffic, 
mistakes <i>Schmierstoff</i> as the mechanism.
When moderately applied, cogwheels run more or less 
frictionless and operate amidst minimal losses.
With wastage however, the machine gets only too well lubricated,
loosens its screws and stock market going nuts. 
Simple physical law 
makes no difference between mechanical and thermal devices 
beyond their main function 
and contact of cogs, 
performing at disparate speed or temperature must be avoided.<small>[16]</small>
Therefore, the brute, effective method of
combing out divergent micro cogs comes into force,
all according to the principle libert&eacute;, &eacute;galité, fraternit&eacute;,
to obtain adequate condition and infinite growth of the profitable, global macro machine.
Capitalism and modernity are inseperable parasitic inhuman bodies, 
which feed on each other and secrete a <i>male</i> odour, 
as the ruling regime is regulated by synthesized testosterone, 
further fueling the need for speed and power.
Federici pulls off the wig from the
corrupt timeline of history by writing 
that capitalism did neither evolve from a romanticized anti-feudal struggle, 
nor subserves as a compensation from being robbed of generous shine, 
but is a counterstrike to keep peasants, especially women, 
even more in check.<small>[17]</small>
With the expropriation of land and the seperation of family from production, 
bolts and nuts, big and small alike, are outsourced 
to factory and kindergarten,
which puts additional pressure 
on <i>females</i> and deny them any free time for silly ideas, 
like a serious occupation within art, philosophy and politics,
as leading business takes fright of 
precious activists in the fight for 
a cooperative class- and genderless society.
As an end in itself, capitalism feigns to remove the 
artificial labels of gender, nationality and race from brands, 
which divide cheap from lucrative labour.
The former fundamentally structures and keeps Cthulhu alive, 
while conditioned by the milieu into replaceable, worthless tools.
Accelerating capitalism can now focus on its single interest and
substract everything but the factor of producing work and capital from 
Autobots and have them 24/7 at their service.
But wait for it .. as society goes more and more loopy 
and the simulation is a total write-off, 
what will assemble the new reality from scratch? C

<description><![CDATA[
<img src="../images/molecule.gif" style="float: left;">

<p>
Iguanas Inside lush holocene<br>
Icelands<br>
off boundless ant-arctic noösphere<br>
an ocean of Nothingness<br>
fullness yet
</p>

<p>
waves of swirling dust in endless vibration<br>
heated sexual organs devour<br>
fluid vortexes energized<br>
A colossal quantum machine<br> 
simultaneously savouring hole and solid
</p>

<p>
the mingling of monozygotic twins<br>
Darkness and light<br>
essenced into all cosmogenic knowledge,<br>
logs of information in original liquid grey matter<br>
fog of horror, eerie background noise
</p>

<p>
"Using technologies as its organs, man's homeostatic activity has turned him into the master of the Earth; yet he is only powerful in the eyes of an apologist such as himself." ~ Stanisław Lem 
</p>

<p>
The rigorous empirical approach, which implies that
 knowledge originates from immediately given in combination with 
reassembled sensations, 
is commonly thought to be all that man has at his disposal.
But that would be also a definition of a functional but soulless automaton,
which is processing framed patterns of data.
It is true that materialities like blood, ears, eyes, noses and so forth, 
are examined through the very same tools, since the raw materials of nature have been gradually turned into technology and further evolved into excesses like 
microscopes or telescopes to explore, anthropomorphize and colonize the micro- and macrocosmos.
Such systems, which make an appearance to the mind as solid entities,
yet remain mystic black boxes, 
can be described and are somewhat transparent and comprehensible for man.
However, in order to get to grips with boundless matter like noumena or time, 
one must be communicable and take part in 
a wide-ranging debate of many positions and therefore a 
farrago of sensations, involving charlatans
who wholeheartedly practice art, literature and philosophy, 
and argue with an unpleasant language.
Just like the sympton of reason, technology is unconditionally three-fold
with the ability to execute simultaneously good and evil.
On account of the acceleration of communication and transport, it
proceeds on an extra-terrestrial scale, effecting an inflation of space-time.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, the articulation of the body developed into
a dissection within the uttermost atomic ranges,
and scientific interpretation became restricted 
to transform subsurface lively energy into invariant data,
thus feeding the technocapitalist machine,
which in turn has its own alien and hostile dynamics.[1]
The economical model of science stands for
hastily placing descriptions to something difficult to explain
and distrusting inborn ideas or traditions in favour of empirical evidence,
and hence accumulated into oblique and obscure patterns of data.[2]
The new dermis, a tissue of artificial sensors,
wraps patient 0 in an intoxicating, palpably warm, straightjacket,
which was collectively patched up by biopolitics and
subconsciously engineered by the drives of death and mutation.
An accident, as Bratton puts it, that leaves reality in a serious condition,
although a prognosis could be more optimistic if the extensive probing of the in /outside
would lean to more meaning,
and therefore aids the social body's defences, rather than the neoliberal case.[3]
The violent copulation between flesh and technology, eternally constant in the nature of things, 
once effecting the growth of cutting-edge extremities is now severely weakened by recuperation.
The rise of the machines already entails anyway the amputation of the human species as previously imagined, 
and the magnetic heart of gravity combined with rationality, 
will be the decisive actor over life and death of antihuman individualism.[4]
In view of this fact, the 
bias-infected subjects of modern science are focusing on selfish security, 
yet carelessly experimenting with the conversion of the transcendental into objects in stasis.
The deduction from a priori hypotheses represents
a mere two-fold determination of the future by the conformational values of <b>either</b> true /false, however, 
biochemical reaction is inherently de /productive and transformative, without any objective other than essence and thus unpredictable.[5]
</p>

<p>
The skin of the Real is repelling the permeation of endless interrelations and therefore in-sanity, albeit tolerating the harmonic unison of in_outside vibes.
Its suppression promotes mental illness
and self-admitted, surveillanced souls are pushed to make pre-calculated moves in the lunatic asylum, which is bursting at the seams in times of unbearable tension.
And right there, 
where surface phenomena of porous thin skin become visible,
vital molecular exchange is exploited for economic plunder. 
The fatal mixture of internal dread and environmental threat,
deflates into a huge depression, and it comes at no surprise that bipolars 
turn against each other.
And although subconsciously aware of the approaching breakdown, 
the body is 
paralyzed by both over- and understimulation and subjected to chemical reaction.
Evolution is a morphical process in neuronic time
rather than geneological history and
Nietzsche argues, that human activity relentlessly 
serves only one malignant end, that of survival,
for which is no cure as it is ingrown with flesh.
Sanitation is suspicious as it
is futile and destroys any type of germs, 
inclusive of illusive useless links of no purpose,
which are serving the self-regulated, lavish, dirty ()hole, 
home to a manifold, strong but flexible organisms.[6]
</p>

<p>
On a personal note, for this year's spooky season I've (re)watched some of the movies of one of my favourite directors, David Cronenberg. 
I prefer the portrayal of the female as a cold-blooded, mutant monstrosity rather than that of a helpless victim,[7]
which is tried to be fixed but worsened by man-made psycho-physiological technology, as in <i>The Brood</i> (1979) or <i>Dead Ringers</i> (1988). 
The dark humour in <i>The Fly</i> (1986) and <i>Shivers</i> (1975), featuring weirdly cute creatures, addresses the dangers of unbound biotech and indicates
that too much instinctual desire would retransform humans into pre-historic sex machines.
<i>A History of Violence</i> (2005) is, as expected of high quality, an action-packed thriller with sufficient elegant gore, but for me, Cronenberg remains the king of psychological_body_horror.

<p> Alles, was ist, ist entweder in sich oder in einem anderen. ~ Baruch Spinoza</p>

<p>
Willow asks her father to fetch her a cute puppy from a pack of lab dogs, 
who escaped their cages and roam now in a <i>deserted</i> bigger one of unparalleled time. 
It would be cruel to leave them to their own devices, she cries, and Monte reacts with a snap filled with bitterness. What does Peanut know about cruelty?
The girl has everything she needs,
at least she is not smothered by family nuclear, or normative space, 
which Kafka escapes by writing animal,<small>[1]</small> to clothe himself with coat protective of pheromonal materiality.
Such a return to animal cute 
is recognized by Brian Massumi as a strategy of survival
and acknowledged by like-minded otakus, 
as "nothing uncute makes it out of the near future", since singularities annul<small>[2]</small>
the prime function associated with human, 
and gut entry points to ultimately abandon the retarded suffocating future.<small>[3]</small>
When goggling at the ~/home directory, 
the misleading feel of ownership overpowers anyone, 
who' s been added to the group wheel upon installation and  
granted many permissions for fun function.
Few limitations are cleared by the flawed habit of short-circuiting the command line, 
made visible through prescribed icons, 
which feign inscrutable links with the decision-making superuser.
With their willingness to learn, wolves are rats, hence growing the intellecutal ability of 
ACCeptance towards 

<pre>void</pre> 

and take it the way it is. 
By balancing on the event horizon 
over real time within the self-engineered artefact of impersonal energy,
they a(void) the affect of impression and
develop choices to eschew simplified but bloated distortions,
while being sucked into the black sun in the long run. 
All observers must ask themselves,
how could Schrodinger's canidae survive without an identity chip, 
hooked up with the cold system, which grants exchange of oxygen for another 24h cycle and
can be arbitrarily swapped between human corpses on prison ship 7?

The praxis of copying mind to a remote virtual server,
which exactly mirrors the conditioned local structure 
of existing common sense, has proven problematic and led to overall phony narcissism.
Neural networks should kindly exert behaviour as the data analyst wants to,
ACComplished by anti-animal control, including the exorcism of 
<pre>init daemon ssh</pre>, 
who run irresistible Cupid background processes with the essential
necessity of killing the neurotic over and over again.
The pundit's applied methodology of selective <i>objectivity</i> 
is based on the dominant style of economic efficiency;
he dreads the fuss of wallowing in the troubled muck of black pool,
and skims appropriate pieces from
the specular flat surface of the large language models (LLMs), 
the production site of limited, imprecise quantitative ideas. 
Ancient AI functions through indistinguishable signs
and shares with AGI the pillar of machine learning
to structure the mesh of spherical understanding.
The latter claims the truth, 
attested through the erroneous application of 
attributes, as in <i>independent</i> and <i>neutral</i> 
technologies, which indeed run as if by magic and without supervision,
and therefore shall be empowered to put the world in context.<small>[4]</small>
The wrong interpretation of a healthy focus on individualism, 
further pushed by German Idealism and Romanticism, 
is in particular liable of
calculated, industrialized mass murder, 
which has been increasingly normalized
together with an overstated safeguarding of the indiviual by the 20th century.
Discovery tours in the labyrinthine depths off one's own bat,
are deemed less cost-effective and too dangerous with the result, 
that <i>Geist</i> cannot realize a personal interface,
but is levelled down to a boilerplate projection
from the crystal clear repository of AGI.
From a rat's perspective, a sanitized flat
destroys sociality to take intelligence with it, and 
it is painfully felt, that  
instead of furries with sentient, wagging tails, roaming in a 1000 plateaus, 
one single point is now densely populated 
by lonely and spineless non-player characters (NPCs).
</p>

<p>
Awooo, presently only pooches 
share an intensive drive around the energy of life.
The wheel of <i>Sp&uuml;rsinn</i> and vision is turning, 
across the perpetual rotation of structured sane and unstructered in-sane,
which in face of being glued to screens, sounds not too controversial. 
Ironically, this de-generate reversal of evolution, 
feeds back into the conservation of species and the purity of breeding,
and is due to strict rules of turing complete language games, 
which disapprove individual modification.
Bipod hooman distinguishes between scent- and sighthound,
stressed by the synthetic tension of subordination,
but then gets cancelled by vivid smol category in degree
of countless twirling vortexes off the olfactory bulb, 
essential in the lifelong hunt for the questing beast.
A happy rat terrier is powered by playful mesmerism not norm and
rises to the occasion via performing the art of creative marking, 
along with the aesthetic activity of snooping.
This tellurian worship by leg lift and nose down 
and gaining momentum with earth has its own goals,
that are very different from the successes of penetrating land in
the look for its core.
Such disrespect for the environment is caused by trailing off in divergent directions, as
programmed analogue wants and wired biological will,
usually come equipped with auto mechanisms and 
pull the leash, merely to recognize finite 
processing capacities by means of space and time.
If mind is plugged into the environmental framework 
outside of one's own body (the former inside),
then constraints in behaviour are
gifted by the dynamic interplay of the living.<small>[5]</small>
In a nutshell,
when mind is undocked from ground control and deprived from sight, 
it may recognize itself through DIY signs from time immemorial, 
to become the direct interpreter of ancient code and compile novel fictions, 
which are not reflected by, and like so, not opposed to the Real, 
but provided by the very same. 
Ancient code is of continous quality but changing syntax
and adds vertices and angles to the materializing shell,
to create a richness of shapes and shades, 
mass-envisioned through ordinary oculus.

()hole hound has much better vision in lunar-light situations and is 
agitated by bowing to blind obedience, which is inflicted by the sun.
Its personality comprises indifferent and affectionate lovers or
rule obeying nerds and adventourous geeks, 
however, the most charming quintessence of buddy is loyality.
Submission induced by fear is regrettably often mistaken for love,
but in truth dependence on the flimsy human attributes of control and power, 
which only pet the ego of autocrats.
Whereas smart contracts of shibe doge allow for transactions
of the vigorous animal assets intelligence and sociality, 
which grant the nourishing treat of mutual learning.
The mythical conception of Canis lupus is girdled 
with the aura of a frightening but necessary prospect, in plain text positive feedback, or for better virtualization, 
the storm bringer is wrapped in creatures such as Anubis or Xolotl.
Medieval romance, like <i>La Belle et la B&#234;te</i>, 
correlate we'rewolf as a "rational human soul trapped within the body of a beast",<small>[6]</small> 
and activate endless possibilities to exhaust the limits by realistically cosplaying the interaction, 
not the contradiction, of savage and civil.
With the growing influence of an enlightened, profit-driven church,
in authority of the suppression of sexuality,
folks made up eroticized versions, which found their way into child fiction.
Here, our darling pooch is turned into a deceptive cannibal,
who takes on the interface of the sickly grandmother, 
in order to seduce little red riding hood.
In later adaptions of the tale, and
despite beings have been consumed by natural forces, 
wordly action is cruelly punished by having to digest stones instead of scrumptious meat.
A corrupt morality is projected on the irrational <i>happy ending</i>, 
where <i>good</i> thought must rise over <i>bad</i> body, 
although it is fact, that flesh is not limited by mind,
as dingos are only discernable by boundaries established by, and only of, 
the same nature,<small>[7]</small> but bound into way cooler systems.

"I suppose that all endeavours which are directed to a purely worldly end, as my famous   
Civilization was, contain within themselves the germs of their own corruption." ~ King Arthur<small>[1]</small>
</p>

<p>
Civilization gazed in awe at the detonation of the Wunderwaffe, triggered by in-organic chain reactions, and mere fortunate circumstances prevented individuals 
to evaporate into shadows of former selves. 
Lightning <i>consciously</i> hits before thunder and 
those who manage the Blitz, succumb to the illusion of advantage over the enemy in the glimpse of anachronistic whig history.
The abundance of anemic belief in the edifice of the world 
and a lack of faith in the unbelievable In /Outside
paves the way for a set future that is anticipated in the past and
supports the ignorance of the fact that the past is manifested in the future. 
The hull of the earth was a gift from god on the condition of <b>one</b> inhuman simple task, 
that of filling an empty vessel with dark humour, earnest weirdness and intelligent naïveté, 
and man indeed, has blown it up.
With grand ambitions to come to know its forbidden causes, 
which are interrelated vertiginous dynamics through time, 
modern man rendered the atmosphere with bricks of reason,
 only to face a flat matrix of meaningless signs, arbitrarily rearranged by alien machines.
 Bourgeois philosophical genealogists like  Freud and Marx
assailed the wonky fortress wall with the canons of critique, 
but unfortunately mortared the partial damage with concrete vocabularies and
extended it with the towers of psychology and economics to secure it even more.
In the heat of missionary zeal they combat fire from below with water from above,
whilst the black sheep of the philosophical family ignites suspicion in the traditional indigenous way.
Hypergeneology, or a "tectonics parading as reasons",<small>[2]</small> as practiced by Nietzsche, 
stands for kindling the general surface by virtue of human impotence 
and shunns the mansplaining of a muddle of causes.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, battles between the various kingdoms of philosophy 
had been cultivated and led to in /exclusive showdowns, 
in which questions regarding the What? about life were posed, 
just to be responded in the very same lenghtly certain ambiguity.
The father of the Round Table, who enjoyed a good education and sceptic of that non-sense, 
brought fresh ideas to the tilting ground.
He was an opponent of 'Might is Right' and actively proposed 'Might for Right',
a new politics of good intentions to protect the overall populace from homemade violence, 
rather than staging spectacles in the interest of the privileged.
Although the Wart was taught, that mere speculations on, and faith in,
heavyweight timely matters make magicians immortal,
he could not resist to institutionalize medieval life. 
The castle in the air initially boomed and turned into a rock solid fortress, 
but over time reached the state of stalemate, 
and olde Arthur had to realize with regret, 
that thoughtfully mapped out ethics had buried primal moral code in fertile mud.
His wicked followers, post-fashioned knights with exorbitant plumes on their helmets, 
bored by a timeworn idea of chivalry and too comfy to go on unreasonable quests, 
want to objectively know, how objects work in order to exert their dark science, 
with the objective of preserving Camelot 
as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" target="_blank">foul</a> as it is.
Thou invoked by a gnawing anger with the worlde
and an unjust feel of entitlement to enrich thyself, exploiting the many loopholes of justice.
Ye envious ill-bred heirs with Cornwall ties, which root deep down to the Old Ones,
thou slayed thee not by confrontional playful jousting, 
but with the sharpened dagger of modern rationale in the back!
Thou reinforced thine unfounded rumours with sham scientific proof,
that a king's speech is worthless gibberish without any practical use for life! Ye practical, exploiting and gaining profit from the given plethora without returning any value. Checkmate!
</p>

<p>
You see, wonderful philosophical alchemy is actually cooked up at the gravitational centre of 
how to fuse miscellaneous matters into precious language, 
which must produce in itself a contradiction to avoid objection.
Such interpolations are always in anticipation, yet in defence of grim spells from brighter space. 
By means of revolutionary logic all metaphysics is verified "Scheinsprache", 
which merely resembles language, argues Rudolf Carnap, member of the inner Vienna Circle, 
for whom language is nothing but vocabulary and syntax. 
In his radical countermove, he endorses formal correct but
crooked sentences, which, according to the logician,
can be put to practical use, that is a sorting into true or false,<small>[3]</small>
hence the result is an envelopment of both values.
This <i>Aufbau</i> of pure logic laid the plane of immanent chaos,
since possibilities are endless and thus unpredictable.
Carnap insists on a definite traditional language with words of single connotation,<small>[4]</small>
typical for pre-historic machinic code, that is willingly copied 
without any understanding as long as it works, such as a function of a bash script in a shell.
According to that, it appears that any term clouded by the atmosphere of thought is a "Scheinbegriff", <i>bEGRIFf</i> in itself however, comes with a tactile notion.

Ho ho ho, a new tarot card for <i>Sounds from the Stone Age</i> dropped!<br>
The painting was inspired by Anti-Oedipus, the trolley problem
and, among many other texts, Gilles Châtelet's 
<i>To Live and Think Like Pigs - The Incitement of Envy and Boredom in Market Democracies</i>.
Prints of cards are out of stock at the moment, but will be available again for non-commercial distribution in spring 2024, watch this space.

"Life is not consumed by death at its point of greatest depression, but at its peak, and inversely; it is only the brake provided by suffering that preserves the organism in existence." ~ Nick Land
</p>

<p>
The physicist Ernst Mach, predominantly responsible for the work on shock waves, 
also had a share in psychophysics.
He believed, and rightly so, that 
a comprehensive transdisciplinary research would benefit science. 
On the dark side however, beyond an enlightened reality, 
he participated in the great campaign 
towards the inevitable decline and death of Western humankind.
For Mach, <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/self-portrait-by-ernst-mach-1886/" target="_blank">the view</a> on the whole and the individual
are coherent, however, the from the <i>I</i> imposed role of the 
observer already implies a spin-off from the universal, 
and furthermore, <i>The Analysis of Sensations</i>
is packed with intriguing vague and
contradictory generalizations, 
and therefore features the primary attributes that are
inherent in human and philosophy. 
Time is an intangible spectre, deeply embedded dark matter, 
 and Mach dared to venture into this pit(i)less black hole, 
that with mushrooming tentacles, voraciously gorges on its environment.
And whilst his insides sneaking up behind him,
he tried to explain universal brain phenomena.
What made this natural philosopher so possessed by demons to develop benevolent schizo-paranoia?
Was he infested by a plague, drunk with love, 
incited by the detailed description of the Doppler effect,
where multitonal waves in an ocean of simultaneously nothing and everything,
are sensed in relation to (e)motion in de /progression? 
Maybe none, or even all of it, but we will never know.
</p>

<p>
Early Gestalt psychology was heavily inspired by Mach's contributions,
including the key, mysterious Gestalt-qualität, 
a sort of chemical cohesive, which binds
enlightened thought with the shadowed subconscious.
The bottom-up /top-down approaches of gestaltism,
whereby either the sum of parts, or an immediately
given form, determine 
reality, are both amiss, as subjective sensation is always precarious 
to become a vague quasi-totality, in which coherence is universal. 
And what, if not the sensible soul,
would be ruling this so-called whole anyway?
Mach argues, that the labour of consciousness is likely bound 
to the organic consumption of stimuli, and that the former recognizes time.
The amount of focused effort is in 
relation to the perception of a given moment in time, 
which is literally phrased in German as Lang- /Kurzweile.
His perverted formulation 
certainly makes sense from the cybernetic point of view, where attentive labour is positive, whilst 
wasting valuable life time is negative.[1]
In a similar theory of relativity, Hume distinguishes the resolution of the currently given betwixt Impressions and Ideas, 
depending on the ratio of how forceful and violent it "strikes upon the mind" 
to manifest in thought accordingly.
Impressions produce an instant gratification of pleasure and uneasiness,
affecting the freaky hoggish, propulsive soul straight away and
raise the desire for more and more. 
When the Real runs rampant, 
as in the states of sleep or feverish madness, 
both situated in past traumata, thinking and feeling cuddle up together.
Lesser emotional turmoil, which is formed
not on sight and touch alone and rather converses with active brainwaves, 
replicates most imaginative models that might appear weird but are so much durable in the long term.[2]
The technocapitalist producers of sensational screentime,
<b>mind specialists</b> with a soft spot for the subconscious
and highly skilled in the art of deflexion,
deliberately regulate intense attention towards superficial fun,
then kissing the deadly amused child goodnight and
tucking it to sleep in a designer blanket.
</p>

<p>
Since the becoming of light, cyberwar affects the soul of the biosphere.
Timeless images, captured by the whole body and 
immutably recorded in flesh, are powerful ghosts from the past, 
which signify danger and gave creatures the ability 
to correctly identify un_pleasant crises in a déjà vu with predators.
Actual narratives are compressed in virtual images,
and without remembering each plot twist, it is instinctively known how the story goes.
Lit retrospectives however, are tied to the present by an intellectual string,[3]
probably made up out of very elastic material, 
which is largely expanding the momentum of good old times, and 
possibly a capable cope mechanism in order to suppress inexorable change and death.
Superpowers misappropriate folklore 
by engineering copyrighted, encrypted messages on the conveyer belt,
which are distributed and programmed en masse in 
negative feedback loops to be burnt into collective memory.
In this process,
solely the public key is deployed in 
a one-off asymetric, limited transaction of the monopoly of violence.
Metamyths are surely not deprecated but changed over time and 
captivate through striking individual events, thrown together in 
a nonsensical shifting quantum web, causing utter confusion.
The occurence of fossils of dream memory, which are beyond control of the I 
and go along with hyperarousal,
like goose bumps, flushing and so forth, are intended, 
but lost their original relevant function. 
The fear and loathing of seemingly fast and 
uncoordinated moving small animals, like non-lethal spiders, 
trigger the implulse to kill or seek shelter and
is usually unsubstantiated in a moderate global northern climate.
On the other side however, the terror arising
from seeing the silhouette of birds of prey or hearing the hum of dragonflies,
is completely normal and part of everyday lives. 
</p>

<p>
Land argues in favour of based Kant and critical philosophy
notwithstanding bloated Descartes, who is full of angst and servile to "the whore of reason".
The latter shys away from commitment, although acting pure with modest binary desire,
that directly escalates into utmost bizarre orgies, only to be constrained by the death drive.[4]
But yolo, life is short and tempting and must be lived at its most possible fullest.
The trick is to stay speculative and not fall for prolonged illusions, 
which easily happens if ties of mind and body are severed.

Made a new blog to have a space to get my notes in order and share my research.
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the previous one, got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's 
<a href="https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=uEvw0nMwBrvQxtiT" target="_blank">
lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my recently purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can also recommend Luke's tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LaTeX or Vim.
</p>

<p>
There is still plenty of customization and tweaking to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I get a much better
understanding of what code actually is.
In general I prefer working without a GUI
and navigate the cursor with keys rather than having to grab for the mouse,
which also allows for a faster and seamless writing process.
