<p>
Made a new blog to have a space to get my notes in order and share my research.
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the previous one, got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's 
<a href="https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=uEvw0nMwBrvQxtiT">
lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my recently purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can also recommend Luke's tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LaTeX or Vim.
</p>

<p>
There is still plenty of customization and tweaking to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I get a much better
understanding of what code actually is.
In general I prefer working without a GUI
and to navigate the cursor with the keys rather than having to grab for the mouse,
which also allows for a faster and seamless writing process.

lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my newly purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can totally recommend Luke's older tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LateX or Vim.

There is still plenty of tweaking and customising to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I learn a lot how code works, 
which is usually hidden behind buttons.

<p>Made a new blog to build my brand. 
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the old one, got too bloated for my taste. 
I wanted to try Luke Smith's simple and lightweight lb script for ages, 
so I gave it a shot after a fresh Arch install on my new laptop, a refurbished 
Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay.
</p>

<p>There is still plenty of tweaking and customising to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom 
than the average platform content creator. 
With building a blog nearly from scratch, I learn a lot how code works, 
which is usually hidden behind buttons.
