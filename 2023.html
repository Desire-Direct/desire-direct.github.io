<p>Made a new blog to build my brand. 
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the old one, got too bloated for my taste. 
I wanted to try Luke Smith's simple and lightweight lb script for ages, 
so I gave it a shot after a fresh Arch install on my new laptop, a refurbished 
Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay.
</p>

<p>There is still plenty of tweaking and customising to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom 
than the average platform content creator. 
With building a blog nearly from scratch, I learn a lot how code works, 
which is usually hidden behind buttons.
