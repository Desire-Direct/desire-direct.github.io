<p>
Made a new blog to have a space to order my notes and share my research.
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the previous one got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's 
<a href="https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=uEvw0nMwBrvQxtiT">
lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my newly purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can totally recommend Luke's older tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LateX or Vim.

There is still plenty of tweaking and customising to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I learn a lot how code works, 
which is usually hidden behind buttons.
