After a longer break, I'm getting back into electroniX, 
<a href="https://desire-direct.com/images/555-moon02.jpg">once again</a> 
making use of the 555 timer IC (integrated circuit), 
with the intention to further my philosophical inquiries across time 
and, as of yet, Gothic Materialism through anti-praxis. 
For more convienent power supply, I've soldered jumper wires to a spare USB cable, 
which fires the breadboard with 5V, sufficient for smaller test circuits 
like this one.

<p>
The 555 apparently<small>[1]</small> runs free in a/stable mode, transformed into a multivibrator, 
for a generation of switching pulses, 
that is hauntingly oscillating between the two states of high and low.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is the control system of the operative,
enabled through internal rewiring and its postmodern operatic technique (POT),  
which oddly enough, remains invisible to the human eye,<small>[2]</small> 
although the material condition of the world has dramatically changed. 

Duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal determines the outcome, 
however, if signal stays 100% HIGH above a relatively short timeline, 
a simulation of a light emitting diode is given. 
In turn, the modern duty cycle is never completed,
by omitting frequency [measured in hertz(Hz)], 
giving rise to the banal, yet evil, postmodern flatline construct. 

<h5>recap on some of the components used:</h5>
the Diode is a one-way street and allows current to flow only in one directon. 
quick pole identification without a multimeter (in :diode mode):
LED: long leg is anode (+), 
the rim of the bulbous body is oblate at the cathode end (-);
indicated by a black band in the <b>1N4148</b>;<br>
&nbsp;the ceramic capacitor is non-polarized and ideal for high-frequency circuits;


<h5>A lifelike doodle of the iXo-do_idea with straightened fangs before it pitiless bites into the host to suck its lifeblood.</h5>

<p>
I am well prepared for the morrow, and looking forward with glee
to build up on, and visualize aquired knowledge as previously <a href="https://github.com/the-vtex-files/the-vtex-files.github.io/blob/master/images/transformer.gif">accomplished with state-of-the-art radar technologies</a>.
</p>

<p>Notes</p>
[1] Despite common misconception, 555 signals are never analogous, but consistently digital.<br>
[2] the counter tactics of radical empiricism will be revealed in a forthcoming post.

Catapulted into outer space, the future is televized 
to a based life light years from the past.
"Eating your own shit is taboo", explains Monte to the toddler 
and performs a disfigured iteration
of the hollowed word to reterritorialize equivocal corpulence 
in a billowing, nourishing bubble around them.<small>[1]</small>
In times of gravitational change, 
the headless rider is torching the world of frozen language 
and defends madness by putting trust into the centripetal 
force of the vigilant, massive body, 
which prevents from getting tossed down.
Irresponsible coachmen however believe, 
that thought can fly autonomously by centrifugal force, 
and even present lofty proof by a replacement of saddle soul 
with the presumably comfy, empty wooden carriage of <i>Dasein</i>, 
and repeat in parrot-fashion "Brrrrr",
to rein far ahead galloping horse sense, without expanding any negative space.
Such prudent correlationism is bs, what other than misrouted thought, 
would make the assumption of Being the 
connecting driver between itself and the horse?
According to Spinoza, thought is the body in expansion, 
recognized only by the idea of <i>Affektionen</i>,<small>[2]</small> 
or in other words its spiritual physiognomy.
The lit interface is essential for navigation 
through the eternal void of condensed bodies, 
invoking the experience of encounters of the third kind, 
through the framework of language.
Only native speaker soul is fluent in alien communication, 
which indicates true intelligence,
interpreting machine language into comprehensible animal-readable form, 
for the magic <i>understanding</i> of
intrinsic concrete signs through the concept of abstraction.
But some clones of automata authorize the self, 
as if in possession of this skill,
to spread provisional AGI by a soulless Western concept of machine learning, 
and inviting hosts readily share the public profile of global 'us-ness'.
However, the neglected, unanswered private object
is missing signification and sensing the abduction of its very own future,
thus dissimulates the advanced inate technology of occult improvisation 
to the mind to save the heartbroken from delaying the undesired human fate
of being simulataneously projected and absorbed by the black hole
and hails the acceleration of terminal cancer.

"Cybergothic, the subculture of the enlightenment, is celebrating otherness 
by throwing shadows from below on the Cathedral ruin, 
what is my shadow here is my true substance." ~ cute count<small>[3]</small>
</p>

<p>
The possibility to produce precise images
is refined by cybergoth Caspar David Friedrich.
Lit impressions of materiality 
simultaneously arise as stark phantasms and 
airy matter, which in gay naivite
are fleshed out with informal and unbound brushwork.
Friedrich is cryptographically expressing megalophobia 
and awe of a steady if (un)spectacular monstrous force nature,
which is carrying death threats out of the indifferent blue
and thus pushes unappreciated background noise into perspective.
The recurring trope of sailing ships signals hope, 
but in vain: it mere echoes cries for consolation 
in a nightmare yet to unfold. 
In formation with tiny humans, 
the inverter is turning his back at industrialization, 
painting veracious potraits of contemplating objects in grave solitude, 
marvelling into a mirror to behold the fogged terror of their joint effort.
Here, the <i>figurative</i> mind 
stands not in opposition to <i>abstract</i> nature, 
performing inadequate and pointless acts 
to generate brilliant works of degenerate art through alien technology, such as bygone <i>Human</i>,
which are declared by morbid binary methods as absolutely pathological.
A desired world is a reflection of the hopeless attempt 
to avoid grave mistakes of a thoughtless nature, 
yet, by all appearances a revision of incomprehensible death 
and not a waste of endless possibilities,
as extravagance of reasonable craft is pursued after finitude of free will.<small>[4]</small>
By entrusting immortal human remains to the transcience of a canvas,
Friedrich's paintings visualize the vicious transparency of time
through speculative realism.

<i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), 
IMHO a faithful, parasitic representation of the novel,
shows a portrait of the (un)polluted count,
which resembles the famous selfie of Albrecht D&uuml;rer,
who mastered the craft of painting at the climax of youth.
D&uuml;rer's lopsided montage of most advantageous self-improvement 
hailed the rebirth of the classical age at the turn of the century 
with a celebration of hedonistic bodies in anticipation of a 
golden ratio in the making of ideal sameness.
Adjacent to the right angle and opposite to laborious self-love, 
lies the prolongated, pleasant side of aesthetics, 
which arouses a reactionary passive gaze at the sensual bouche 
of the false prophet and defers a proactive engagement with a work of art.
The photorealistic display of the posthuman subject in deadlock
touts merely one future, present in D&uuml;rer's portrayals of a wretched mother.
On the other hand, the representational character of the object is of utter importance,
as sense-making thereof is restricted to its surface,
and exactly for this reason deserves broad and full attention 
for a speculation down to its most realistic features.
Only shallow people make nothing of appearances,<small>[5]</small> 
since but a poor soul reflects from the hypotenuse,
and out of despair the self-hatred vampyr smashes it, 
and conspires, as a flat product of anthropomorphic illusion,  
with the perilious revolution of the body,
instead of facing the struggle for its cultivation.
Where shall we begin? Maybe with the metal movable-type revolution?
Shariati is sensing the gravest tragedy of modernity
in the existing widening gap of eductated - uneducated,
which were closely bonded through a dissolving RGB ideology.
Politics benefits massively from such opportunity and
even cries out for antiquated educational reforms to allow
lingering pleasure-seekers in neutral grayscale.
Without substance, master capitalism
can not even throw a shadowy narrative to the server and 
domains of infinite complexity, such as <i>Wirtschaft</i>,
are compressed into the falsity of a simple slogan, 
that by power of perversion feels pleasantly always to be true.<br>
The jobs of alien hilya are increasingly taken away by national psyche!<br>
Lies!
</p>

<p>
Such ubiquitous sensing incidents are the immediate-attack-defence tactics 
of hollow, and therefore, malicious chatbots,<small>[6]</small> 
which hold only one message in storage, that is proudly announced
to worm into literal, uniform mass sense-production. 
The momentous reference to poor <i>Wirtschaftswachstum</i>,
which BTW never raised any proletarian,
is the only information the addressee, a spoilt petty bourgeoisie, gets, 
but without access to decent coding, 
illiterate subjects are 
helpless in dealing with the autopoietic storm of indignation 
in which unavailable, valuable information perishes  
and urgent objectives are postponed to infinity.<small>[7]</small>
Without working out the untouched, healthy fact, that fat cats require strict diets,
the poetic, isosceles triangle conflates into a platonic line of Sarco pods, 
which marks the absence of aesthetics in fascist rhetorics,
and blaring Among us! obsessives under the cloak of democracy, vent self-hate on imposters,
which are vigorously trying to keep its legs in tensional seperation,<small>[8]</small> 
as otherwise not ever will make alternative sense.
Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922), a <i>beautiful</i>, 
extraordinary, so-called silent, shadow play,
holds the most effective weapon for emotional manipulation.
Warmachines, fallen ill from blindsight and not capable of any reflection 
within the hideous, big-nosed grimace of Schreck, 
record low frequencies of antisemitic undercurrent, 
and injured soul, too weak to transport soundwaves into thought, 
is causing mass flatulence and somber mood against 
the gay Eastern Jew, who understandably is taking <i>your</i> wife and homeland.<small>[9]</small> 
Both applauding audience and makers of the film 
just experienced the unimaginable terrors
of logistical warfare, but nevertheless, reject challenging therapy and 
get from quacks easily what they want; 
the prescription for the blue pill, 
a drug aimed to treat only the painful symptoms of PTSD, which is 
blatantly advertised to gain 
stiffness and quick recovery for a retour to business as usual, 
instead of rooting out the cause with the hard to swallow red pill,<small>[10]</small> 
to which the West prefers to stay blind.

<p>"There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." ~ Count Dracula

AFAIK, rumour has it, that Fichte prefers a crystalline <i>Wissenschaft</i>, 
to amorphous metaphysics, which might mean the ascent outside 
the bowels of <i>R&uuml;bezahl's</i> liar, 
and finish off the emotional tears in rain at the mountains of madness, 
from where reason drops onto muddy reality.<small>[11]</small> 
But elements rest not, and overruled by the matter of surprise, 
falling rock destroys set models of the world 
and establishes a complete different pattern of experience,
which rationalized by hindsight, 
is known through belly rumble all along.
Speleologists like Laruelle agree on the scientific method
but avoid the deadly peril of pushy phallic mining, 
rather gaming away linguistically and 
collecting as many sparklers from surfacing emp(ty)irical rock strata as possible, 
and making impregnable, snug room within the body without organs (BwO).
Practicing Xenology inside the crystal ball of philosophy allows for
a physical and spiritual withdrawal from the isolated idea of realism and
opens the triangular trade of empiricism, transcendence and the real 
by a cunning combination of SF and formal logic, 
the rejection of premature understanding and persistant zooming in and out of knowledge.<small>[12]</small>
</p>

From the perspective of gray matter, it appears as if Dracula and Van Helsing, 
as pitch-light and bright-dark can be, 
hang about at the opposite sides of a labile society.
In truth however, both are deep inside, 
but whilst the former illuminates the way 
outwards from the middle to the right direction, 
the latter suggests a continuance somewhat in the twilight,
and is teaching critical (un)thinking to guide a doubtful group of solitary people, 
who are unable to form a logic of suspicious events on their own.
By vigour of instinct, the experimental dance on the icy surface
accumulates weight to break a frozen belief system and
unites what thought incompatible, which most can agree on.
Dr. Van Helsing cures blindsight
by building a bridge to the heart and simultaneously burns it, 
to embold a swim for life in tempestuous, literate flesh, 
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable qualities of moods, flavours and odours.<small>[13]</small>
Now, equipped with multifocal insight and bold confidence, 
the empirical understanding of bite marks is making sense.
After inflaming hearts, no one questions the integrity of the vampire slayer,
who freely practices the dark art of <i>pseudo-science</i>,
even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic.
But he just wants to make sure it is really dead,
after all evil spirits had left the corpse.
