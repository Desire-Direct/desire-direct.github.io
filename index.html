"Using technologies as its organs, man's homeostatic activity has turned him into the master of the Earth; yet he is only powerful in the eyes of an apologist such as himself." ~Stanislaw Lem 
</p>

<p>
The rigorous empirical approach, which implies that
 knowledge originates from immediately given in combination with 
reassembled sensations, 
is commonly thought to be all that man has at his disposal.
But that would be also a definition of a functional but soulless automaton,
which is processing framed patterns of data.
It is true that materialities like blood, ears, eyes, noses and so forth, 
are examined through the very same tools, since the raw materials of nature have been gradually turned into technology and further evolved into excesses like 
microscopes or telescopes to explore and colonize the micro- and macrocosmos.
Such systems, which make an appearance to the mind as solid entities,
yet remain mystic black boxes, 
can be described and are somewhat transparent and comprehensible for man.
However, in order to get to grips with boundless matter like noumena or time, 
one must be communicable and take part in 
a wide-ranging debate of many positions and therefore a 
farrago of sensations, involving charlatans
who wholeheartedly practice art, literature and philosophy, 
and argue with an unpleasant language.
Just like the sympton of reason, technology is unconditionally two-fold
with the ability to execute simultaneously good and evil.
On account of the acceleration of communication and transport, it
proceeds on an extra-terrestrial scale, effecting a rising inflation of space-time.
</p>

<p>
In the meanwhile, the articulation of the body developed into
a dissection in the farthermost molecular ranges,
and scientific interpretation became restricted 
to transform subsurface lively energy into invariant data,
thus feeding the technocapitalist machine,
which in turn has its own alien and hostile dynamics.[1]
The economical model of science stands for
hastily placing descriptions to something difficult to explain
and distrusting inborn ideas or traditions in favour of empirical evidence,
and hence accumulated into oblique and obscure patterns of data.[2]
The new dermis, a tissue of artificial sensors,
wraps patient Earth in an intoxicating, palpably warm, straightjacket,
which was collectively patched up by biopolitics and
subconsciously engineered by the drives of death and mutation.
An accident, as Bratton puts it, that leaves reality in a serious condition,
although a prognosis could be more optimistic if the extensive probing of the in /outside
would lean to more meaning,
and therefore aids the social body's defences, rather than the neoliberal case.[3]


<!--
The damaging side effects of the copulation between flesh and technology,
,which is as old as the entire biological kingdom itself, 
are always countered by recuperation.
Although the rise of the machines would 
probably entail the amputation of the human species
as previously imagined and its rule of antihuman individualism
something new.

The real skin repels the permeation of infintie interrelations and therefore 
insanity, inner vibes in unison with the outer transformative processes
as evolution is a metamorp<hical process in neuronic time, rather than geneological history.

The suppression of the Real promotes mental illness,
and self-admitted, surveillanced souls are pushed to make precalculated moves in the 
lunatic asylum, which is bursting at the seams in times of unbearable tension.
And right there, in the loopholes of liminal meat
, molecular outbreaks are exploited for economic plunder. 
A fatal mixture of internal dread and environmental threat,
deflates into a huge depression and it comes at no surprise that bipolars 
turn against each other.
Both over- and understimulated and subjected to chemical reaction are
paralyzed, yet subconciant aware of approaching breakdown 

Every human activity relentlessly serves only one purpose, 
that of survival and there is no cure as it is ingrown with flesh.a
The sanitization destroys any type of bacteria, those imperceptible and useful links of no purpose
serving the self-regulated, lavish, dirty ()hole, home to strong but flexible organism.

On a personal note, this year's spooky season I've (re)watched some of one of my favourite directors movies, David Cronenberg. 
I prefer the portrayal of the female as a cold-blooded, mutant monstrosity rather than that of a helpless victim,[6]
which is tried to be fixed but worsened by man-made psycho-physical technology, as in The Brood (1979) or Dead Ringers (1988). 
The dark humour in The Fly (1986) and Shivers (1975) features weirdly cute creatures, 
addresses the dangers of unbound biotech and that too much ínstinctual desire would revert us into mere sex machines.
A history of Violence is, as expected of high quality, an action packed thriller with sufficient elegant gore, but for me, Cronenberg remains the king of psychological_body_horror.

Made a new blog to have a space to get my notes in order and share my research.
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the previous one, got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's 
<a href="https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=uEvw0nMwBrvQxtiT" target="_blank">
lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my recently purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can also recommend Luke's tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LaTeX or Vim.
</p>

<p>
There is still plenty of customization and tweaking to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I get a much better
understanding of what code actually is.
In general I prefer working without a GUI
and to navigate the cursor with the keys rather than having to grab for the mouse,
which also allows for a faster and seamless writing process.
