<p> Alles, was ist, ist entweder in sich oder in einem anderen. ~ Baruch Spinoza</p>

Willow asks her father to fetch her a cute puppy from a pack of lab dogs, 
who escaped their cages and roam now in a <i>deserted</i> bigger one of unparalleled time. 
It would be cruel to leave them to their own devices, she cries, and Monte reacts with a snap filled with bitterness. What does Peanut know about cruelty?
The girl has everything she needs,
at least she is not smothered by family nuclear, or normative space, 
which Kafka escapes by writing animal,<small>[1]</small> to clothe himself with coat protective of pheromonal materiality.
Such a return to animal cute 
is recognized by Brian Massumi as a strategy of survival
and acknowledged by like-minded otakus, 
as "nothing uncute makes it out of the near future", since singularities annul<small>[2]</small>
the prime function associated with human, 
and gut entry points to ultimately abandon the retarded suffocating future.<small>[3]</small>
When goggling at the ~/home directory, 
the misleading feel of ownership overpowers anyone, 
who' s been added to the group wheel upon installation and  
granted many permissions for fun function.
Few limitations are cleared by the flawed habit of short-circuiting the command line, 
made visible through prescribed icons, 
which feign inscrutable links with the decision-making superuser.
With their willingness to learn, wolves are rats, hence growing the intellecutal ability of 
ACCeptance towards 

<pre>void</pre> 

and take it the way it is. 
By balancing on the event horizon 
over real time within the self-engineered artefact of impersonal energy,
they a(void) the affect of impression and
develop choices to eschew simplified but bloated distortions,
while being sucked into the black sun in the long run. 
All observers must ask themselves,
how could Schrodinger's canidae survive without an identity chip, 
hooked up with the cold system, which grants exchange of oxygen for another 24h cycle and
can be arbitrarily swapped between human corpses on prison ship 7?

The praxis of copying mind to a remote virtual server,
which exactly mirrors the conditioned local structure 
of existing common sense, has proven problematic and led to overall phony narcissism.
Neural networks should kindly exert behaviour as the data scientist wants to,
ACComplished by anti-animal control, including the exorcism of 
<pre>init daemon ssh</pre>, 
who run irresistible Cupid background processes with the essential
necessity of killing the neurotic over and over again.
The pundit's applied methodology of selective <i>objectivity</i> 
is based on the dominant style of economic efficiency;
he dreads the fuss of wallowing in the troubled muck of black pool,
and skims appropriate pieces from
the specular flat surface of large language models (LLM), 
the production site of limited, imprecise quantitative ideas. 
Ancient AI functions through indistinguishable signs
and shares with AGI the pillar of machine learning
to structure the mesh of spherical understanding.
The latter claims the truth, 
attested through the erroneous application of 
attributes, as in <i>independent</i> and <i>neutral</i> 
technologies, which apparently run as if by magic and without supervision 
and therefore shall be empowered to put the world in context.<small>[4]</small>
The wrong interpretation of a healthy focus on individualism, 
further pushed by German Idealism and Romanticism, 
is in particular liable of
calculated, industrialized mass murder, 
which has been increasingly normalized
together with an overstated safeguarding of the indiviual by the 20th century.
Discovery tours in the labyrinthine depths off one's own bat,
are deemed less cost-effective and too dangerous with the result, 
that <i>Geist</i> cannot realize a personal interface,
but is levelled down to a boilerplate projection
from the crystal clear repository of AGI.
From a rat's perspective, a sanitized flat
destroys sociality to take intelligence with it, and 
it is painfully felt, that  
instead of furries with sentient, wagging tails, roaming in a 1000 plateaus, 
one single point is now densely populated 
by lonely and spineless non-player characters (NPCs).

Awooo, presently only pooches 
share an intensive drive around the energy of life.
The wheel of <i>Sp&uuml;rsinn</i> and vision is turning, 
across the perpetual rotation of structured sane and unstructered in-sane,
which in face of being glued to screens, sounds not too controversial. 
Ironically, this de-generate reversal of evolution, 
feeds back into the conservation of species and the purity of breeding,
and is due to strict rules of turing complete language games, 
which disapprove individual modification.
Bipod hooman distinguishes between scent- and sighthound,
stressed by the synthetic tension of subordination,
but then gets cancelled by vivid smol category in degree
of countless twirling vortexes off the olfactory bulb, 
essential in the lifelong hunt for the questing beast.
A happy rat terrier is powered by playful mesmerism not norm and
rises to the occasion via performing the art of creative marking, 
which goes along with the aesthetic activity of snooping.
This tellurian worship by leg lift and nose down 
and gaining momentum with earth has its own goals,
that are very different from the successes of penetrating land in
the look for its core.
Such disrespect for the environment is caused by trailing off in divergent directions, as
programmed analogue wants and wired biological will,
usually come equipped with auto mechanisms and 
pull the leash, merely to recognize finite 
processing capacities by means of space and time.
If mind is plugged into the environmental framework 
outside of one's own body (the former inside),
then constraint in behaviour is 
gifted by the dynamic interplay of the living.<small>[5]</small>
In a nutshell,
when mind is undocked from ground control and deprived from sight, 
it may recognize itself through DIY signs from time immemorial, 
to become the direct interpreter of ancient code and compile novel fictions, 
which are not reflected by, and like so, not opposed to the Real, 
but provided by the very same. 
Ancient code is of continous quality but changing syntax
and adds vertices and angles to the materializing shell,
to create a richness of shapes and shades, 
mass-envisioned through ordinary oculus.

()hole hound has much better vision in lunar-light situations and is 
agitated by bowing to blind obedience, which is inflicted by the sun.
Its personality comprises indifferent and affectionate lovers or
rule obeying nerds and adventourous geeks, 
however, the most charming quintessence of buddy is loyality.
Submission induced by fear is regrettably often mistaken for love,
but in truth dependence on the flimsy human attributes of control and power, 
which only pet the ego of autocrats.
Whereas smart contracts of shibe doge allow for transactions
of the vigorous animal assets intelligence and sociality, 
which grant the nourishing treat of mutual learning.
The mythical conception of Canis lupus is girdled 
with the aura of a frightening but necessary prospect, or in plain text positive feedback, and for better virtualization, 
the storm bringer is wrapped in creatures such as Anubis or Xolotl.
Medieval romance, like <i>La Belle et la B&#234;te</i>, 
correlate we'rewolf as a "rational human soul trapped within the body of a beast",<small>[6]</small> 
and activate endless possibilities to exhaust the limits by realistically cosplaying the interaction, 
not the contradiction, of savage and civil.
With the growing influence of an enlightened, profit-driven church,
and the suppression of sexuality,
folks made up eroticized versions, which found their way into child fiction.
Here, our darling pooch is turned into a deceptive cannibal,
who takes on the interface of the sickly grandmother, 
in order to seduce little red riding hood.
In later adaptions of the tale, and
despite beings have been consumed by natural forces, 
wordly action is cruelly punished by having to digest stones instead of scrumptious meat.
A corrupt morality is projected on the irrational <i>happy ending</i>, 
where <i>good</i> thought must rise over <i>bad</i> body, 
although it is fact, that flesh is not limited by mind,
as dingos are only discernable by boundaries established by, and only of, 
the same nature,<small>[7]</small>
but bound into way cooler systems.
