"Life is not consumed by death at its point of greatest depression, but at its peak, and inversely; it is only the brake provided by suffering that preserves the organism in existence." ~ Nick Land

The physicist Ernst Mach, predominantly responsible for the work on shock waves, 
also had a share in psychophysics.
He believed, and rightly so, that 
a comprehensive transdisciplinary research would benefit science. 
On the dark side however, beyond an enlightened reality, 
he participated in the great campaign 
towards the inevitable decline and death of Western humankind.
For Mach, <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/self-portrait-by-ernst-mach-1886/" target="_blank">the view</a> on the whole and the individual
are coherent, however, the from the <i>I</i> imposed role of the 
observer already implies a spin-off from the universal, 
and furthermore, <i>The Analysis of Sensations</i>
is packed with intriguing vague and
contradictory generalizations, 
and therefore features the primary attributes that are
inherent in human and philosophy. 
Time is an intangible spectre, deeply embedded dark matter, 
 and Mach dared to venture into this pit(i)less black hole, 
that with mushrooming tentacles, voraciously gorges on its environment.
And whilst his insides sneaking up behind him,
he tried to explain universal brain phenomena.
What made this natural philosopher so possessed by demons to develop benevolent schizo-paranoia?
Was he infested by a plague, drunk with love, 
incited by the detailed description of the Doppler effect,
where multitonal waves in an ocean of simultaneously nothing and everything,
are sensed in relation to (e)motion in de /progression? 
Maybe none, or even all of it, but we will never know.

Early Gestalt psychology was heavily inspired by Mach's contributions,
including the key, mysterious Gestalt-qualität, 
a sort of chemical cohesive, which binds
enlightened thought with the shadowed subconscious.
The bottom-up /top-down approaches of gestaltism,
whereby either the sum of parts, or an immediately
given form, determine 
reality, are both amiss, as subjective sensation is always precarious 
to become a vague quasi-totality, in which coherence is universal. 
And what, if not the sensible soul,
would be ruling this so-called whole anyway?
Mach argues, that the labour of consciousness is likely bound 
to the organic consumption of stimuli, and that the former recognizes time.
The amount of focused effort is in 
relation to the perception of a given moment in time, 
which is literally phrased in German as Lang- /Kurzweile.
His perverted formulation 
certainly makes sense from the cybernetic point of view, where attentive labour is positive, whilst 
wasting valuable life time is negative.[1]
In a similar theory of relativity, Hume distinguishes the resolution of the currently given betwixt Impressions and Ideas, 
depending on the ratio of how forceful and violent it "strikes upon the mind" 
to manifest in thought accordingly.
Impressions produce an instant gratification of pleasure and uneasiness,
affecting the freaky hoggish, propulsive soul straight away and
raise the desire for more and more. 
When the Real runs rampant, 
as in the states of sleep or feverish madness, 
both situated in past traumata, thinking and feeling cuddle up together.
Lesser emotional turmoil, which is formed
not on sight and touch alone and rather converses with active brainwaves, 
replicates most imaginative models that might appear weird but are so much durable in the long term.[2]
The technocapitalist producers of sensational screentime,
<b>mind specialists</b> with a soft spot for the subconscious
and highly skilled in the art of deflexion,
deliberately regulate intense attention towards superficial fun,
then kissing the deadly amused child goodnight and
tucking it to sleep in a designer blanket.

Since the becoming of light, cyberwar affects the soul of the biosphere.
Timeless images, captured by the whole body and 
immutably recorded in flesh, are powerful ghosts from the past, 
which signify danger and gave creatures the ability 
to correctly identify un_pleasant crises in a déjà vu with predators.
Actual narratives are compressed in virtual images,
and without remembering each plot twist, it is instinctively known how the story goes.
Lit retrospectives however, are tied to the present by an intellectual string,[3]
probably made up out of very elastic material, 
which is largely expanding the momentum of good old times, and 
possibly a capable cope mechanism in order to suppress inexorable change and death.
Superpowers misappropriate folklore 
by engineering copyrighted, encrypted messages on the conveyer belt,
which are distributed and programmed en masse in 
negative feedback loops to be burnt into the collective memory.
In this process,
solely the public key is deployed in 
a one-off asymetric, limited transaction of the monopoly of violence.
Metamyths are surely not deprecated but changed over time and 
captivate through striking individual events, thrown together in 
a nonsensical shifting quantum web, causing utter confusion.
The occurence of fossils of dream memory, which are beyond control of the I 
and go along with hyperarousal,
like goose bumps, flushing and so forth, are intended, 
but lost their original relevant function. 
The fear and loathing of seemingly fast and 
uncoordinated moving small animals, like non-lethal spiders, 
trigger the implulse to kill or seek shelter and
is usually unsubstantiated in a moderate global northern climate.
On the other side however, the terror arising
from seeing the silhouette of birds of prey or hearing the hum of dragonflies,
is completely normal and part of everyday lives.

Land argues in favor of based Kant and critical philosophy
in contrast to bloated Descartes, who is full of angst and servile to "the whore of reason".
The latter shys away from commitment, although acting pure with modest binary desire,
that directly escalates into utmost bizarre orgies, 
only to be constrained by the death drive.[4]
But yolo, life is tempting and has to be lived at its most possible fullest.
The trick is to stay speculative and not fall too long for illusions, 
as could easily happen, when ties of mind and body are severed.
