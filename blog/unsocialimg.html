The open pipe dream signals a cozy, bustling hibernation in the dark forest
of grim winter intensity.
A 
<a href="https://github.com/Desire-Direct/assassin-rice/blob/master/scripts/unsocial_img">
free gift</a>
to all the people of the market, 
including adventurous ones, who are travelling 
to remote places,
customizing individual needs with common sense.
When the old King is dying,
future hooks come apart in Chinese whispers,
smartphone's fallout from its ashy cloud,
melting from dazzling ones into whooping zeros.
The Pinecone fulfils almost every wish
for a wet robot, who sorts the cluttering matrix 
with help from hovering drones.
Bits and bytes of lebkuchen nibbled
from ancient code, passed on from our forebears 
as it is tradition, 
quickening the appetite to run a fat chunk of meat.
In endless testing of thin loops, 
the maiden's mind trickling with blood, 
spinning transfusional webs 
to micro-burn monotheistic AI,
so she can deep dream for a 101 years.

And pouff! The toxin is gone!<br>
Jazzin' perls are
heralding the wedding of the resurrected virgin with the beast,
and a sulphurous match is lightening the user-unfriendly app from hell, 
that will joyously perform its miracle all around the Linux community, 
but not for her conceitedness of android, google or mac.
