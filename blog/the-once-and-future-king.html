"I suppose that all endeavours which are directed to a purely worldly end, as my famous   
Civilization was, contain within themselves the germs of their own corruption." ~ King Arthur<small>[1]</small>
</p>

<p>
Civilization gazed in awe at the detonation of the Wunderwaffe, triggered by in-organic chain reactions, and mere fortunate circumstances prevented individuals 
to evaporate into shadows of former selves. 
Lightning <i>consciously</i> hits before thunder and 
those who manage the Blitz, succumb to the illusion of advantage over the enemy in the glimpse of anachronistic whig history.
The abundance of anemic belief in the edifice of the world 
and a lack of faith in the unbelievable In /Outside
paves the way for a set future that is anticipated in the past and
supports the ignorance of the fact that the past is manifested in the future. 
The hull of the earth was a gift from god on the condition of <b>one</b> inhuman simple task, 
that of filling an empty vessel with dark humour, earnest weirdness and intelligent naïveté, 
and man indeed, has blown it up.
With grand ambitions to come to know its forbidden causes, 
which are interrelated vertiginous dynamics through time, 
modern man rendered the atmosphere with bricks of reason,
 only to face a flat matrix of meaningless signs, arbitrarily rearranged by alien machines.
 Bourgeois philosophical genealogists like  Freud and Marx
assailed the wonky fortress wall with the canons of critique, 
but unfortunately mortared the partial damage with concrete vocabularies and
extended it with the towers of psychology and economics, to secure it even more.
In the heat of missionary zeal they combat fire from below with water from above,
whilst the black sheep of the philosophical family ignites suspicion in the traditional indigenous way.
Hypergeneology, or a "tectonics parading as reasons",<small>[2]</small> as practiced by Nietzsche, 
stands for kindling the general surface by virtue of human impotence 
and shunns the mansplaining of a muddle of causes.

Once upon a time, battles between the various kingdoms of philosophy 
had been cultivated and led to in /exclusive showdowns, 
in which questions regarding the <b>what</b> about life were posed, 
just to be responded in the very same lenghtly certain ambiguity.
The father of the Round Table, who enjoyed a good education and sceptic of that non-sense, 
brought fresh ideas to the tilting ground.
He was an opponent of 'Might is Right' and actively proposed 'Might for Right',
a new politics of good intentions to protect the overall populace from homemade violence, 
rather than staging spectacles in the interest of the privileged.
Although the Wart was taught, that mere speculation on, and faith in,
heavyweight timely matters make magicians immortal,
he could not resist to institutionalize medieval life. 
The castle in the air initially boomed and turned into a rock solid fortress, 
but over time reached the state of stalemate, 
and olde Arthur had to realize with regret, 
that thoughtfully mapped out ethics had buried primal moral code in fertile mud.
His wicked followers, post-fashioned knights with exorbitant plumes on their helmets, 
bored by a timeworn idea of chivalry and too comfy to go on unreasonable quests, 
want to objectively know, <b>how</b> objects work in order to exert their dark science, 
with the objective of preserving Camelot 
as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566.pdf?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" target="_blank">foul</a> as it is.
Thou invoked by a gnawing anger with the worlde
and an unjust feel of entitlement to enrich thyself, exploiting the many loopholes of justice.
Ye envious ill-bred heirs with Cornwall ties, which root deep down to the Old Ones,
thou slayed thee not by confrontional playful jousting, 
but with the sharpened dagger of modern rationale in the back!
Thou reinforced thine unfounded rumours with sham scientific proof,
that a king's speech is worthless gibberish without any practical use for life! Ye practical, exploiting and gaining profit from the given plethora without returning any value. Checkmate!

You see wonderful philosophical alchemy is actually cooked up at the gravitational centre of 
<b>how</b> to fuse miscellaneous matters into precious language, 
which must produce in itself a contradiction to avoid objection.
Such interpolations are always in anticipation, yet in defence of grim spells from brighter space. 
By means of revolutionary logic all metaphysics is verified "Scheinsprache", 
which merely resembles language, argues Rudolf Carnap, member of the inner Vienna Circle, 
for whom language is nothing but vocabulary and syntax. 
In his radical countermove, he endorses formal correct but
crooked sentences, which, according to the logician,
can be put to use, that is a sorting into true or false,<small>[3]</small>
hence the result is an envelopment of both values.
This <i>Aufbau</i> of pure logic laid the plane of immanent chaos,
since possibilities are endless and thus unpredictable.
Carnap insists on a definite traditional language with words of single connotation,<small>[4]</small>
typical for pre-historic machinic code, that is willingly copied 
without any understanding as long as it works, such as a function of a bash script in a shell.
According to that, it appears that any term clouded by the atmosphere of thought is a "Scheinbegriff",<i>bEGRIFf</i> in itself however, comes with a tactile notion.
