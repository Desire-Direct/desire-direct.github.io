Looking at R to draw some math graphs,<br>
just to find myself in Python's data science again.<br>
and yes, it comes with its own environment<br>
I've stumbled across R markdown,<br>
reluctant to install bloated LaTeX again,<br>
appeared to be an even bigger bloat<br>
without any useful documentation to find.<br>
</p>

<p>
Still missing LaTeX<br>
with its sovereign elegance, still<br>
In need of a simple PDF compiler,<br>
to automatically resolve<br>
what needs to be done,<br>
without having to arduously 'self-engineer' the .doc<br>
and it shows<br>
Microsoft /Libre office<br>
</p>

<p>
glad having found groff > groff <br>
and to my pleasant surprise<br>
came already installed together with the base-devel package of arch<br>
which by far simplest syntax<br>
giving that wonderful feel of editing a PDF document<br>
directly in "real" "time"<br>
or 'seeing what you will get',<br>
with a single prompt in the CLI.<br>
