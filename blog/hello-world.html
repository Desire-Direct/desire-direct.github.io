Made a new blog, so I have a space to order my notes, 
and because Jekyll, which I've used to generate my previous one got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's [lb script](https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=IbfqLSHnwI6WqB9F) for a long time, 
so I gave it a shot and forked it 
after a fresh Arch install 
on my newly purchased (refurbished) Lenovo Thinkpad from ebay.
I can totally recommend Luke's older tutorials on old-skool applications like Vim or LateX.

There is still plenty to modify 
like ever√Ωthing when on a Linux machine, 
but it gives me much more freedom and control than the average platform blogger,
and in the process there's much to be learnt.
