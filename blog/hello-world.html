<p>
Made a new blog to have a space to get my notes in order and share my research.
Jekyll, which I've used to generate the previous one, got too bloated for my taste.
I wanted to try Luke Smith's 
<a href="https://youtu.be/jIfAdzGmhik?si=uEvw0nMwBrvQxtiT">
lb script</a> for ages, 
so after a fresh Arch install on my recently purchased (refurbished) Lenovo ThinkPad from ebay,
I gave it a shot and forked it. 
I can also recommend Luke's tutorials on old-skool applications like ImageMagick, 
LaTeX or Vim.

There is still plenty of customization and tweaking to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom than the average platform content creator.
In the process of building a blog nearly from scratch, I get a much better
understanding of what code actually is.
In general I prefer working without a GUI
and to navigate the cursor with the keys rather than having to grab for the mouse,
which also allows for a faster and seamless writing process.
