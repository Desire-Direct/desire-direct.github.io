Ho ho ho, a new tarot card for <i>Sounds from the Stone Age</i> dropped!<br>
The painting was inspired by Anti-Oedipus, the trolley problem
and, among many other texts, Gilles Ch√¢telet's 
<i>To Live and Think Like Pigs - The Incitement of Envy and Boredom in Market Democracies</i>.
Prints of cards are out of stock at the moment, but will be available again for non-commercial distribution in spring 2024, watch this space.
