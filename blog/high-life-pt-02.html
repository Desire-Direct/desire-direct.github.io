<p>Total mobilization and motorization have always been two sides of the same coin in the race for biological and technological supremacy. ~ Paul Virilio
</p>

<p>
The film <i>High Life</i> points out the malfunctions of a <i>civil</i> engineered social health, condensed onboard the cubicle ship, where happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced on mad cogs, who are optimized killer robots to fight a primitive war of all, against all. In light of slowly approaching death, a passive, overboiling aggression is radiated by those who swallow the toxic cocktail of sedating medication and  misdirected care, with the effect of becoming too dulled to be cured by emotional shock.<small>[1]</small>
Classical mechanics serves as the chassis for theoretical physics,<small>[2]</small>
which commands the total wreckage of matter
and a re-coupling of progressively pulverizing residues
in order to stabilize the triumph of mechanistic will.
The assembly instruction for the Western thought model,
facilitates the most popular innovation of technological progress
and phased out bots, equipped with innumerable sensors, are lined up 
to download special algorithms from a dodgy source.
The supposed upgrade strives to provide a stable version while centred on efficiency,
and what reads as the failed paradox of a rolling-release without any significant updates,
truly turns out as a downgrade with the empty prospect
to process information into static truths,
which are situated on the one-dimensional image of time.
So where hides the malicious bug?
Machinic desire is the ignition wire, which encloses all ever so resistent ambiguity with mechanistic laws, but simultaneously fuses
schizo-paranoid undercurrent into positive feedback cycles, 
that power Nothing but meltdown culture.
<i>Kurzschl&uuml;sse</i> expose the "alien order of time",<small>[3]</small> 
and generate traumatic awakenings in the past, 
in which the aftermath of a clash 
between flesh and tech becomes grossly perceivable.
Such future shocks paralyze rational action and trigger contagious angst, 
responsible for the breakout of the modern condition 
and its negative feedback cycles, which causes
man to merely fetishize his wounds and scars and 
squeeze the thick cable back into the engine space
as if Nothing is happening.
</p>

<p>
Such regulating action always has consequences, 
warns Ludwig Boltzmann in view of the escalating sci-fi spectacle,
and reminds us of the omnipotence of Outsidedness,
while torn up bodies plotting revenge for the assault on their senses. 
On another page, Boltzmann, overtaken in a dangerous curve by current events,
lectures, that modern physics is incapable 
to unhinge the world but social order. Prima facie he comments:
'the Decepticons are way behind to reach the finishing line as champions,
as they only exert themselves in hair-raising situations,<small>[4]</small> 
and show-off Optimus Prime looks like the certain winner.'
From his obscured vision in time, he misjudges the position of
the outsider Megatron, who leads the field by a margin of one lap.
To unhinge something requires a stable point in space,
but <i>civilized</i> Autobots, supplied without the innate sense of balance,
bend over for the Decepticons, who send them straight onto the <i>Autobahn</i>
with the promise of total freedom. 
Fooled by amazing mirages under the drumming, blazing sun, nobody, 
besides unwavering idiots, wants missing out on opportunities 
to grab bloody resources at numerous service stations or
recklessly cut off more modest models. 
Regardless the obscene excess,
dissatisfaction with the nonetheless boring death drive 
grows into a reign of road rage 
and Autobots crash at full throttle into the concrete posts errected by human hubris.
Consequential congestions 
lead to the direct absorption of cancerous fumes, 
that poison the brain and effect a high on emotion, 
which defies any logic or reason.
Thus, the isolated in metal cages
arrive at the wrong conclusion of "not everything was bad" - 
right nevertheless, according to general thermodynamics, which 
states that traffic chaos increases with progress.
</p>

<p>
The vain attempt to shut off the cosmos with the arrow of time 
is rather based on psychological opinion seated near the the rear-wheel axle,
than on unbiased fact in the beam of headlamps, and
the associated, severe problems are stressed by Boltzmann, 
who calls for the provisioning of additional, 
more comprehensible trains of thought.<small>[5]</small>
In the same context Negarestani says that, 
reasoning is deduction, not a one-sided elemination technique,<small>[6]</small>
and once the geometrization project is total wreckage, 
algebra, with its effort to balance, increases known unknowns on one side,
but on the other do away with unknown knowns irreversibly, to break even "=" heat death. 
Meanwhile, the <i>treibende Kraft</i> is
busy with the production of difference and disproportional harmony, 
which is self-righteously turned into a function for statistical prediction,
that substracts any originality from the maximum value of <i>chaos</i>,
until Nothing is left but total <i>order</i>.
For around 1000 years, the once fictional hype is pushed by 
capitalism into reality, and the longer the trip time,
the greater the fervour in supporting and defending 
the <i>Autobahn</i> with its feigned liberty, 
which enforces acceptance of a straightfoward limitation 
on the mind. 
Turning manoeuvres on the displaced two-directional lane 
are not permitted, but some are driven to commit suicide and murder, 
and when trying to take the next exit, 
the trump card is played to instill a climate of fear,
as meandering roads through vast foreign landscapes
come with great uncertainty, 
a quality most unbearable by those with a lack of aplomb. 
But don't fret, shiny neoliberalism, 
the great road works project maintaining and expanding the <i>Autobahn</i>, 
provides alternative routes for Autobots with catalytic converters,
which are not better models but run a more bloated software, that
further accelerates state-of-the-art drive technology.
Woke drives from the same point of departure allow for interesting views, 
depicted by racing legend Negarestani as "nebulizing agents",
which fog undeveloped space and potential escape routes behind a
complex mapped out territory, where all roads lead to destination sunset.<small>[7]</small>
</p>

<p>
"The function of imagination is to generate catastrophes for thinking, and the function of thought with regard to imagination is to escape the limits of imagination." 
</p>

<p>
writes Negarestani and spots a colossal piston seizure, 
that locks the overheated rational loop.<small>[8]</small> 
He consults a <a href="https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2018/05/30/what-descartes-robot-daughter-can-tell-us-about-the-zombie-problem/">classical mechanic</a>, who proves his meditation skills by rerunning the loop over and over, but stays
unsuccessful in detecting any certain indications.<small>[9]</small>
Descartes, doubtful of all statistical truths, 
acknowledges the deceptive, yet necessary function of the engine, 
which leads autobots to believe "I think, therefore I am".
He diagnoses the <i>I</i> as a fantasy, duped by eyes into <i>consciousness</i>, 
all realized by the unshakable Transformer,
who fabricates the utmost complex, 
weird mesh of Cybertron by quantitative experience, or "the law of custom",<small>[10]</small> in relation to steady updates from the animated cartoon series.
The lovers of wisdom recommend to take regular pit stops and
bumping into Megatron in close range and at slow speed,
losing oneself in unknown space and time and
letting go by putting Optimus Prime into a transient coma.
Despite avoiding collision course with pursuit 
and crossing the finishing line in periods of limited visibilty, 
the judges decide to exclude the stable 
by reason of in-sanity altogether, 
as no competitive, media-effective spectacle can be sould.
Fortunately, cogs have choices in which dream factory they want to be employed,
and of either producing novel, thought-provoking films in close collaboration or
AI generated movies loosely based on profit, 
in which the modern fairytale only repeats itself. 
However, opting for Optimus Prime and interlocking in solidarity 
means, that "All actions from now on seem more or less liberating because in fact none of them are."<small>[11]</small>,
as well as giving up on
the accelerating roundabout in Geneva, 
which hosts the top tier of motor sports, Formula 1, that tries 
to reinvent preestablished harmony.
Instead, it implies to approach life as a rally
and solving problems in creative negotiation with its surroundings on a day-to-day basis
in a close-knit team of driver, navigator and technician.
Spattered by mud and blinded through all invading dust,
makes the bumpy ride in the spur-of-the-moment exasperating, 
as a whole though, an unforgetable experience. 

The ups and downs generate opportunities to turn, which 
appear to the eye in comparison with a diagram and and its flat line, 
as too slow for <i>Endsieg</i>,
but real life experiments reveal, 
that only time in itself slows down,
with completion on its side.
</p>

<p>
Boltzmann approves traditional <i>Kraftstoff</i> dualism,<small>[12]</small>
but frowns upon the lopsidedness of modern science,
which for one thing steps far beyond its objective 
by the conservation of energy and momentum,
but remains ignorant towards vital tasks.
This conduct has grown into a bad habit and is 
replicated by conservative politics and <i>freie W&auml;hler</i>, 
who are just as unscrupulous about energy procurement and disposal.
Stubbornly, they look ahead while driving backwards, 
or at best, make sorrowful use of the rearview mirror,
but without turning around, the terrors inflicted by  
digital automation, embodied in assembly lines and rail tracks 
linger in a blind spot. <i>Aufkl&auml;ung</i> comes with the great expectation of a
finely tuned interplay between body, mind and soul, 
instead it only focuses the <i>eye</i>
to translate unreliable impression directly into
functional thought,
and neglects the heart, which in turn fogs the understanding of time even more.
The hyperstitional catalyst absorbs <i>Kraftstoff</i> 
as if there is no past nor future, and the whole 
world, insensitive through ubiqutious 
violence and media, watches as masses of pedestrians and cyclists 
are murdered by legions of autobots.<small>[13]</small>
With the Copernican Revolution, the <i>Abendland</i> finally recognized 
heliocentrism and heedlessly promoted a conducting hot star 
to <i>The - Modern Times - Great Dictator</i>, 
which bore crippled for life anthropocentrism.
Meanwhile, the cool cosmos, 
a billowing compound of atoms with unlimited mobility,<small>[14]</small>
to whom attributes like coldness or heat are alien, 
sparked the innovation of more capable, flawless combustion engines, 
which are mere abstract models based on the image of its creators.
Now available with soulless in- and output,
they surrogate for cumbersome debates with friends,
resulting in deafening silence.

The ordinary sun dial promotes all work no play,<small>[15]</small>

automated dissected for more efficiency, 
into more  user-friendly devices.
Machines of sunshine try to quench the insatiable thirst for information,
by cleansing all meaning from the much enlightening byproduct noise, 
only to manage a hyperproduction of the reputed vermin.

Boltzmann, seemingly excited about automated human traffic, 
mistakes the <i>Schmierstoff</i> as the mechanism.
When moderately applied, cogwheels run more or less 
frictionless and operate amidst minimal losses.
With wastage however, the machine gets only too well lubricated,
loosens its screws and stock market going nuts.

Federici resolves the corrupt timeline of progress by writing 
that capitalism does not evolve from a romanticized anti-feudal struggle, 
but is a counterstrike to keep peasants, especially women, 
primary cogs in the fight for 
a cooperative class- and genderless society, even more in check.<small>[16]</small>
Capitalism and modernity are
inflating, inseperable parasitic inhuman bodies, which feed on each other,
to satisfy the male desire for linear progress and speeding.


Contact of cogs moving at different speeds which still applies for computed statistics, and intervenes with isolation and regulation of253 difference in temperature to convert many individial micros into one universal macro machine according to the principle libert&eacute;, &eacute;galité, fraternit&eacute;. 


With the expropriation of land and the seperation of family from production, 
bolts and nuts, big and small alike, are outsourced 
to factory and kindergarten,
putting additional pressure 
on females by having to keep the private machine in motion.


As an end in itself, capitalim feigns to remove the 
artificial labels of gender, nationality and race from brands, 
which divide cheap from valuable labour.
On the other side,within the hyperstitional american dream of optimistic, negative growth,
horse sense makes no difference of who is 
the beast of burden and who is the ass.

Wiht the destruction of the family, 
accelerating capitalism can now focus on its single interest,
to substract everything but the factor of producing work and capital from 
human resources and have it 24/7 at their service.

In conclusion, worthless life stock fundamentally structure capitalism
and is conditioned into tools to produce, consume and die,
locked up in a machine and robbed from shine, which otherwise
provides for free food and warm shelter.


The mechanization of the body is a control mechanism for the soul,
which claims freedom for thought,
 but puts unbearable stress on the nervous system


But wait for it ... as society goes more and more loopy to end up in a fatal crash with the simulation as a total write-off, 
who will assemble a new reality from scratch?
