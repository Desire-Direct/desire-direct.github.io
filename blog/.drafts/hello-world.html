<!-- LB -->
Made a new blog, as Jekyll, 
which I've used to generate the old one got too bloated for my taste. 
I wanted to try out Luke Smith's simple and lightweight lb script for ages, 
so I gave it a shot after a fresh Arch install.
There is still plenty of tweaking and customising to do, 
but I have much more control and creative freedom 
than the average platform content creator.
