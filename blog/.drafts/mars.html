Willow asks her father to fetch her a cute puppie from a pack of dogs, 
which roam in unparalleled time
deserted spaceship, probably feeding on human corpses.
She argues, it would be cruel not to do so. Monte calmly answers, you don't know what 
cruelty is. Monte is the man, who killed a humanoid body with identity, 
who in turn killed his best buddie, to become imprisoned guinea pig facing death sentence.


The overlapping of communal agreements on objects
and individual re /cognition generate normative space, 
a structure based on language.

But if the general human mind a container, 
it will only reproduce limited imprecise quantitative ideas
originating from  sense perceptions from a random point in normative space,

It present no true knowledge about the world, 
only snippets of current state
distorted perceptions of own body and others. 

If body thought interplay there would be no limit?
bad body / good thought, always restraint


Private thoughts do not happen, we thinking 'freely', 
but bound to normative space and bound to gravitas of body.
normality should actually be a safe space, to protect us from apparently cold, brutish, mad nature.


But normative space closed systems, conservation of energy

A modern event horizon is theoretical physics, 
an entry to the black hole of a collective subconscious, 
and Boltzmann has to admit, it is an efficient way to satisfy the practical
necessity of linear progress, 
to straighten and make an infinite end to the frightening eternal return,
from which, being honest and thinking rationally, there is no escape. 

He adds it did not unhinge earth, the actual free spinning mothership,
but social order, restructuration of thought and perception.


greed for information
According to the news, he writes, that hoary wifi is 
a modern discovery and identifies the 
mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, 
which sadly emerged as a soul-, instead of mind-crushing lever, 
as the starting point of ape developing human.(38)


Under the Second Law of Thermodynamics it is observered that hot matter is 
<i>universally</i> attracted by coldness
and with state-of-the-art technology, it becomes more and more difficult
to identify a cool replicant.

In the industrial age, humans applied machines with souls, 
cute machines, which mirror our bodies, including energy consumption and excretions.
Which served as a surrogate for
strenously meaningful communicating and vibing with our best friends isolated in the sunshine.
silently  with machines 24/7(40),
automated conversational customer service systems, 
to satisfy the growing demand of information, byproduct of noise 


Boltzman concludes, if the world is mere phantasy sci-fi,  
wrong actions would have no consequences,
but as they do have, 
it is proof that there is an outside,
and right actions can only emerge from challenging the outside. (zweifel)

The movie depicts the pitfalls of modern engineered social health 
on the cubicle ship, here  
happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced 
on  mad cogs, who are 
trained and optimized killer robots and
to fight a primitive war of all against all. 
A radiance of aggression can be observed,
by those who swallow the deadly cocktail of medication, pride and prejudice, 
who have nothing in common but the so-called instinct of survival.

There is scientific proof that cooperation induced into competition
 made forms of biological life possible. 
and sympathy /aggression rule each other not out, but are both vital components
and 'natural' instinct is actually loaded with creativity.

Ground 0 won't change 
but experience by modification, 
for instance adding objects, vertices and angles 
creates a richness of shapes and shades 
whereas the impersonal mesh transmits understanding.

The body of understanding is not sense perception,
as body and mind do not touch, comes with interface.
it must work by induction.

The ongoing news of the animal consortium what makes the in-organic prone to warfare,

the wheel from accoustic to visual space is turning, 
an acceleration of structured sane to the unstructered in-sane,
which in light of being glued to screens sounds not too controversial. 
A degenerate reversal of evolution,

The mind is a unique interface 
but operates through a universal programming language 
and interprets directly meaning of machinic code
it is what it does

the feel of ownership of decision making in the ~/home directory is misleading, 
through permissions given of belonging to the group wheel
usually on installation, habit. 

The GUI allows everyone to participate in computing. 
does the cute interface corrode powers of action?

The mis -interpretation of the alien earth, fatal glitches, 
subsurface added to the engineering of a degenerate world, 
which became an object of massive gravity where not even light can escape, 
once sucked into internalising its imperial ideology of abstraction.

Light and the physiology of the eye might be blamed
