Light and the physiology of the eye might be blamed 
for a specialized hierarchical logic of organized communication,
an inpenetrative radiaton, a psy-op 
disguised as a so-called precision targeted bombing of the ape cerebrum,
which spares no one but the innocent.


In this game, it is dealt with not fixed but moving targets, 
a pursuit without escape,


Ludwig Boltzmann identifies the Knuettel, bludgeon, 
as oranutan as first practical tool lever function, used by the human species.


The mind is a unique interface 
but operates through a universal programming language 
directly meaning of machinic code

generates normative space, 
the overlapping communal agreements on objects
and individual re /cognition


which may change with regards to knowledge and time,
but as embedded in machinic code in fact cannot alter.



Perception of genius AI, that is mainly machine learning, 
from database of objects,
the vibing algorithm, membrane
waiting to tell us something new, apparently independent
findings are presented as pure technical, neutral
and thus truth.





The screen displays a map of cute symbols
hiding a complexity of functions beyond human cognition,
but alien swarm intelligence

Having to guess a-priori what will happen when a certain button is clicked,
by reference to the understanding 
of a pre-existing simulation of a function, which years ago. 






interface may clone, manipulate, kill, from which it thinks is apparently independent
masks truth

anthropomorphize weapons, 
all weapons are metaphors for dicks
thought is the enemy

Fuller diminish
dissolves in fog?

Global warming, by The immense heat produced by processing large datasets, 
Fata Morgana, 
energy

War comes with many faces, 
but in my example I didn't want to make it too complex.




Ground 0 won't change but experience by modification, 
for instance adding objects, vertices and angles 
creates a richness of shapes and shades 
whereas the impersonal mesh transmits understanding.
