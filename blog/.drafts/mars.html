So, also, a thought is limitied by another thought, but a body is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body. 


If the system of knowledge is not sense perception,
as body and mind do not touch, it must work by induction.

The problem of induction, 
is the observation of phenomena, 
which are theoritically inifinte, 
but are mere applied from the practical 
viewpoint,
as the sun doesn't rise always in the East
to unobservable black boxes.


the general deduction from all the things is thus limited . 


induction=einleitung


A very thin layer of ice is mechanics covering a deep rough sea
  on which the total structure of theoretical physics is built upon.

Boltzmann admits, it serves to satification of of pure practical needs.



He writes that hoary so-called wifi is a modern discovery and identifies the 
mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, which evolved into lever(38)

He admits that such progress, 
did not unhinge earth but social order, restructuration of thought and perception
a changed viewpoint, to look at everything like a soulless machine.

right actions can only evolve from challenging the outside.

The ongoing news of the animal consortium what makes the in-organic prone to warfare,

the wheel from accoustic to visual space is turning, 
an acceleration of structured sane to the unstructered in-sane,

A degenerate reversal of evolution,

The mind is a unique interface

the feel of ownership of decision making in the ~/home directory is misleading,

The GUI allows everyone to participate in computing. 
does the cute interface corrode powers of action?

The mis -interpretation of the alien earth, fatal glitches,

Light and the physiology of the eye might be blamed

The fog of war kills the process of resistant vision and engineers a new one,
