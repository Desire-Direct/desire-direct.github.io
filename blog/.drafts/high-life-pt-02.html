The film <i>High Life</i> points out the malfunctions of a <i>civil</i> engineered social health,    condensed onboard the cubicle ship, where happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced on  mad cogs, who are trained optimized killer robots to fight a primitive war of all against all. In light of slowly approaching death, an overboiling passive aggression is radiated by those who swallow   the toxic cocktail of sedating medication and  misdirected care, with the effect of becoming too dulled to be cured by emotional shock.<small>[1]</small>

Boltzmann, overturned by current events, 
is wrong by lecturing that modern physics 
is incapable to unhinge the world but social order.
Prima facie, he comments, 
drives are way behind to reach the finishing line as champions,
as they only exert themselves in hair-raising situations<small>[2]</small> 
and superficial reason looks like the certain winner.

A thrilling race is multidimensional
From his obscured vision in time, he misjudged the position  
the accelerating outsider Thanatos, who leads the field by a margin of one lap.
Meditator risky overtake at great speed and eventually to win the race.  



Future is anticipated by WILL?/body/, 
wich has absolutely no temporal understanding
The partying crowds don't know, 
but nevertheless dance to the rythm of commercial techno tracks,
but already feeling the beat of inborn underground jungle.

Classical mechanics serves as the chassis
for jointly engineering the Western thought model, 
or the instilled template for modernity's socio-political climate?

Even the most thoughtful construction of strategy based on impression,
and regulating action effort, 
later always have consequences,
and here Boltzmann was on the right track with Land, 
importance of challenging the Outside.

emphasizing that machinic desire is the motor, 
and cars emerged as a new force, to unlock blind road rage
as a revenge of assault on the senses.

Thus Capital is not the heart but the lubricant,
but came in as soiled feature of the V8 motor, 
but wait for it ..., as society hasnt worked out its power for higher life yet?

Boltzmann gets truly excited about the 
collective, involuntary  refinement of the utmost complex, 
organism, 
culminating in the "appliance" of regulating  mechanistic laws, 
and the cogwheels meshed only too well.

(boltz, 26)as the most important part of human traffic, 

as its mechanism regulates Mein und Dein, 
or the application of value upon inaccessable essence,
only ownership determines worthy live.

Capital is a catalyst, the accelerator of hyperstitional drives  
The primitive way of simply swapping nuts and bolts
to keep the machine in motion,
civilized cogs innovation of money, burning money
led to the installment of catalytic converters, worsens.


With abundance the motor was only too well lubricated 
all that is solid melts into air, 
and stock market traffic going nuts, 
and nihilists absorbed Kraftstoff, as if there is no past.

Once in the void of capital, no escape from the viscous black mass
but portal

 projecting futures, revolutionary forces 
locked by pre-modern culture (sau rauslassen)
shattering the transcendental screen? conditions the senses  


Capitalism has not destroyed possibilities of the romanticized anti-feudal struggle, 
but 
middle class
the american dream


All living, transcendental stuff, 
unable to trace by empirical methods
made subordinate the domain of mechanics(26),
brought to eXistenZ as  particles and waves, 
gaseous forms further concretized to speed on the data Autobahn, 
in order to satisfy the male desire for linear progress 
and plan to reach at destination sunset, which looms at the horizon.

Fooled by mirages in the boiling sun, 
they ride an accelerating roundabout, 
to reinvent the wheel 
screw loosens.


On the racing circuit in Switzerland, only to be driven on by fat slicks.
the artificial obstacles of gender, nationality and race
have been removed, which identify
the brand identities of cheap labour of lobotomized bots, 
barcodes which fundamentaly support capitalism in its construction and function.
to afford the consumption of excrements of the Ford conveyer belt.


but its emissions, the cancereous fumes 
poisens the brain to get high on emotion.

not a catalyst converter, but a further state-of-the-art drive technology
In lower class motor sports,
a very difficult rally, spattered by mud and throughout invading dust,
sliding icy snow,
and although in the spur-of-the-moment exasperating, 
it makes the overall bumpy ride an unforgetable experience. 

beifahrer, driver and map-reading
Potholes are filled by fluid ideas, forces vehicles to grind to a halt, 
or with enough acceleration with , flying over to land in the ditch,
soon be concretisized by the capitaloscene, appropriated and included in their boring 
race cycle. 

The top tier of motor sports, Formula 1, 
it appears to the eye on a planned diagram,
bumpy ride as much slower, 
but as we will see time itself slows down,
but arrive quicker at the next road section.

Greenhorns protesting the tempolimit, installed by conservative law, 
giving halt by repairing and defending, old trodden Roman roads,
but by doing so actually pumping billions gallons of lubricating oil 
in the upwards spiralling tracks of the hyperstitional loop, 
for commonly enjoyment of the expanding cognetive landscape.


thermodynamics needs Kraftstoff,
hat sich dem Dualism zwischen Kraft und Stoff angeschlossen.
(Büchner, freedom), matter IS motion(33)

Boltzmann is wrong,
that even most complex algos, can not reproduce biological movement.(boltz, 27)
but replicate?,
play god
of materialists and vitalists, mechanistic worldview
into a alien organism Capital, plots its revenge, apocalypse.

(boltz 25,26,27)

With the Copernican Revolution, the <i>Abendland</i> finally discovered 
godless heliocentrism
and put a hot star at the centre of the universe.
and upgraded him from the conductor to The Great Dictator,
which bored crippled for life anthropocentrism.
Popular
Classical mechanics, made a simple but honest viral meme about it.
(symbol clock, stengers)

The ordinary sun dial promotes all work no play, 
a Telecracy (cybernetics), control to be useful for the ego.  
(40) marconi, enlightening news, 
The growing demand of statistical information based on mechanism of control, 
cleansed the former much enlightening byproduct noise, 
hyperproduction of pure noise as in automated conversational customer service systems, 
interactive user-friendliness.


The primitive technical achievements of ancient cultures and true engineers,
like the invention of the wheel, 
prob solved more by hand, 
thought of technology applied later.(boltz, 39?)
dealt merely with the lame earthly conditions of energy and gravity.
to the delight of the phara-oooh.

If there was balance, action stalled regenerate,
alerted cocky, armchair science, 
conservation of energy, BUT never of its exhaustion?


The practical use of technology, is on contemplation a competitive need, 
food, shelter
a creative conflict, negotiated by cooperation with environment.
'erwachender Sinn fuer Technik' (39) (technology/nature abspaltung)
Boltzman identifies the mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, 
which sadly emerged as a round soul-, instead of developing to the edgy mind-crushing lever, 
that for from the human viewpoint, 
is either used murder or the patriotic accumlation of resources
as the starting point of ape developing human.(38-39)

Thermodynamics is the science of complex (open) systems, 
such like person rides a bike. 

Industrialization was already in full blow,
but physics still applied the laws of classical mechanics to thermal engines
(stengers), 
together with fallacy that energy comes from nowhere,
which is absolutely true, considering god has been killed. 


The classics regard motion (time) as given, and only god knows why,
(new: make motion themselves)


(boltz 27)
From the eye of the observer, that
ideas of things not identical with its essence,
featureless essence comes with a opaque lossy varnish, 

translated into images or numeric signs , algebra is a one sided "elemination technique"
but merely replicate indefinite correlations, whilst essence is still not touched. 

If not in itself, just looking at at essence, instead of finding it 
oneself, information increase, entropy WITH time. 


In classical the contact of cogs, moving at diff speed
must be avoided at all cost, otherwise halt.
In thermodynamics
avoid contact matter/bodies having diff temp


energy?
no brassier?

Sadi Carnot, built upon his fathers work
was the first quantitave expression of irreversability ,
until it became a general formula of conservation.
conservation of energy and momentum=motion merely converted and transferred to other bodies
(stengers)


solution, isolate hot and cold, build isothermal change
BUT, theoretical, only concerned with balance the temp EFFECT of combustion
Clausius, how to get back to initial state? need two source of heat


science efficiency of combustion
the problems of energiebeschaffung und abgas 
in conservative politics completely ignored.

Regulation of human traffic, 
hot car owners killing millions of cool pedestrians and cyclists.


Reasoning is deduction, not elimination of phenomena
instead of external train of thought, find on the wrong track, 
cars in traffic jam, due to accident of pushy and speeding science. 
[Boltzmann detects inauguration of progress, 
with pushy Newton applying Galilei laws on universe, 
instead of exploring earthly phenomena. (boltz,6) and Stengers]

Events unlikely to go backward, 
statistics ausschliessen the unlikely, coz psychological
to measure future events, 
linking vermeindliche? unknowns in indifferential equation.
ooo, consequence


Meanwhile, the indifferent universe,
is not bothered neither by conservation
but creation and destruction, to produce difference. 

struggle between thermo and dynamis, 
which stengers meaning of reality and time at stake?

The mind works by dualism,
true diff in temperature, results in difference
but the effort of trying to balance, destroys difference.



Beausoleil
brought about combustion engines, modelled after its creator,
intelligent design mirrored their bodies, 
give them breath by vital spark, 
and fueling the obscene consumption with non-degradable excretions.
Those served as a surrogate for cumbersome, meaningful debate with friends,
resulting in deafening silence.

Time is of no function other than deadly chaos,
and is by all means not its task abused to detect consistency
or presence in <i>dead</i> matter. 

Mc Taggerts A and B series
 is an illusion of the mind to structure the 
mash that is presence in space. 
and evolution of tensed human language is a collateral damage
of neanderthal temporality, to increase the mortality rate.

and B, stable event in unstable world. 

The universe, even the flesh is timeless, 
the mind constructs a temporality, 
to produce fictional reality
memory projects futures.

The interface mind is a reactionary cunt, 
a double-mirrored diaphragm, 
bloat

to outside phenomena (space), experience
inside, hollow






(203)For McTaggart time is not change, 
but stable events (durable molecular structures?Dawkins) in correlation? cause change?
Environmental 'objects/events' ping on the senses,
observation does not correspond to
the present of the events observed
Scheingegenwart(204)
experience mere illusion, because restricted viewpoint(boltz 209)
space (up down), time (left right)
Space and time, each not satisfactorily defined,
to anonymous materials like heat
only applied "objective" characteristics, 
but as given dualism? (p.202)
all that exists/some existent things, (204). Reza favours this, reality qua experience???
(207)how is a priori act of experience fact, (if it is private and contingent?
(208) physics framework would crash, if revision to time
(209)Boltzmann: entropy can only go in one direction, 
later stage, earlier stage, 
"natural events will become ever more dull and uninteresting"
(210) irreversibility explained


Space is basically a mesh without relation? (202)
time is relation????


PCs run with different software installed
The observer (subject) moves forward in time, lol
entropy can encrease not decause,
Physics fired the arrow of time,
carelessly shooting into the nothingness, anthropocentric expansion of universe
whre entropy grows in relation to probability,
relation is subjective


irreversibality
man-made chaos, 

time=Entropy, function measuring chaos 
determine that 
cut past from future

Memory leads us to believe that the past is known, <see paragraph on Mach> 
as can not objectively known, too many aspects in correlation to be fact
as memory itself is temporal awareness, which misleads us into
the unknown future? 
</p>


<p>
No human mind is prone of being tricked by the senses, 
even Newton believed, as a passenger driven by dreams, looking out in a carriage, powered by wild horses, as if time flies by on the outside. specious


Only with glass interface, monitor and meditate true reflection we recognize time in us. 
Unlike coachmen, always present in the moment to see the full picture
turn around, the past looks completely different as anticipated.

the moving image production of time.

the science of thermodynamics, 
wants to show correlation (always subjective) and its variations of energy in systems, 
conservation
used for prediction and management in a controllable environment. 

McTaggart
The arrow of time
what Boltzmann said against A????

Time certainly comes from nowhere but by all means not from the past

the arrow of time suggests irreversibilty?
a progress, denies geometric round


battery eingefroren, smash the fog. (reza)


The Aufklärung is the mechanization of bodies, 
Cartesian conflagration
but algoryhtmic  analogue laws of entwining biological bodies in motion, 
could not psycho-physiological movement, catalyst converter it to machines (cars).

the fear and , uncertainty
lubricating the catalyst hyperstition
leaking on on the burning-hot engine to fan the flames .

It comes with the feature coincidence of short, 
entangled numerous cables occupied by current energy
no surprise, 
non-human readable machinic code, 
opening the conduit (kabelkanal), to become one with the energy.->death

superstitous folks, who put all their beliefs into the One main cable, 
push back in the engine space, as if nothing is happening, 

anticipate the crash, get off by stalling it (orgasm denial) 
they evoke it by evoking paranoia

but exploring the cultural meltdown, brought by unison of tech and body,
anticipate it, in order to fetishize the wounds and scars. 

A crash reveals the 'alien order of time'[Land]
which is otherwise hidden, 
built-in in a accu e-smart, 
intelligent design of fate in 
classic car with combustion engine.

future trauma, with thermodynamics future is written, 
entropy increase to heat death

Lyotard properly cuts the body open to find
the organic body of political economy occupied by
(2)"organized with survival", replacement of parts (not recration?)

Space or being are materials made of pure connexion, 
and it is hard work to disentangle all the cables
for what greater purpose? for third parties?
and there is only access to correlation, 
never to structural design (thought) and engine (being) on its own.


Total mobilization and motorization have always been two sides of the same coin in the race for biological and technological supremacy. Virilo (133)
which Virilio calls the 'war of total mobilization' was
to construct "common collective conscience /memory"(133) 
based on "the cult of information"
(virilio,134)
which somehow erased the the root of evil, 
but capitaloscene
that led to the terror of assembly line, rail tracks
