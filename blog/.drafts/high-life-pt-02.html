The film <i>High Life</i> points out the malfunctions of a <i>civil</i> engineered social health,
condensed onboard the cubicle ship, where  
happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced 
on  mad cogs, who are trained
optimized killer robots to fight a primitive war of all against all. 
In light of slowly approaching death, an overboiling passive aggression 
is radiated by those who swallow 
the toxic cocktail of sedating medication and
misdirected care, with the effect of becoming too dulled to be cured by emotional shock.<small>[1]</small>

With mechanics as the Transformer, 
physics rose to the Optimus Prime discipline of all sciences, 
the corrupt leader of replacable Autobots, 
which obviously made a good deal with Megatron and the Decepticons. 
freedom car, which makes one only more dependent
A mundane financial success story so enormous, that 
the sciences split into mere businesses to compete over progress on the stock market, 
and ditched unprofitable philosophy. 

hyperstition
make smth up that becomes reality (negative feedback cycle)
bring on the apocalypse (positivefeedback cycle)
energy around, 


The concretized application, analytical mechanics,
algorithmic laws of bodies on motion, 
it happened did not start to move at all.

The "primitive" technical achievements of ancient cultures,
dealing the lame earthly conditions of gravity,
and if there was a sense of balance, 
alerted ordinary common sense did not detect any motion.


The god particle, found in the Outside, physics extracted value
removed from human
in search of a distant, artificial equilibrium  

Previous innert a priori knowledge, 
now external train of thought, on the wrong track
reasoning is deduction, not elimination of phenomena, 
true only in closed systems,
refuse relation to others. 

Boltzmann, saw the inauguration of progress, 
with pushy Newton applying Galilei laws on universe, 
instead of exploring earthly phenomena. (boltz,6)

accustic and optics, waves, subordinate to physics can't see with eyes, but kinetic character obviousby only artificial means, to be seen
(boltz 9)

hyperstition radio, first fantasy then reality
then thermodynamics, coz mechanics had the idea, 
that heat IS motion of smallest particles of bodies


alte? Mechanik, 
instead of Kraftstoff, 
hat sich dem Dualism zwischen Kraft und Stoff angeschlossen.
(Büchner, freedom), matter IS motion, what is cause for each movement?
application of this habit of thought
Kirchhoff machte da nicht mit, 
(33)

mechanics foundation of all <b>theoretical</b> physics
now Cocky, armchair science is looking down on engineers, 
who tirelessly, work smart on hands-on "jugend forscht" projects.(true pioneers)
The practical use of technology, is on contemplation a competitive need, 
a creative conflict, negotiated by the induction of cooperation.
means being proactive, even seems in the spur-of-the-moment not easy, 
but makes the overall ride towards , long, pleasurable, sustainable.
Action stalled

Without explaining hoary, virtual technologies like X ray or tele-communications
Boltzman identifies the mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, 
that for from the human viewpoint, 
is either used murder or the patriotic accumlation of resources
as the starting point of ape developing human.(38-39)

'erwachender Sinn fuer Technik' (39) (technology/nature abspaltung)
which sadly emerged as a round soul-, instead of developing to the edgy mind-crushing lever, 
for the need of food and shelter, teledildonics.
True invention by hand, thought of technology later. 
(40) marconi, news
accelerating mechanics was there a break, like with geometrization project?

theoretical physics didnt unhinge the world,
no stützpunkt, elon musk?
in a positive feedback cycle, hyperstition
but social order, apocalyptic
all thought/sensation change, in matter soul

robot, speed, no work and play


Boltzman concludes, if the world is mere phantasy sci-fi,  
wrong actions would have no consequences,
but as they do have, 
it is proof that there is an outside,
and right actions can only emerge from challenging the outside. (zweifel)

Modern theoretical physics is an efficient way to satisfy 
the male desire for linear progress 
and to straighten and make an infinite end to the chaotic
eternal return, from which, when thinking genuine and rational, there is no escape.
to speed on the data-Autobahn and to arrive quicker at destination sunset.

They don't know, built but man-made, 
boring, dangerous,negative feedback cycle, 
racing court(cern). 

remove edifice of race, gender, nation? 
to make an even bigger global edifice?
but class?

Life is a bumpy ride with obstacles, 
and to somebody who does not practice it, it appears to the eye on a planned diagram (meme)
as much slower, and as we will see time indeed slows down 
but quicker to proudly achieve smth, destination Endlösung. 

With enough acceleration, not stopped by 
potholes filled by fluid ideas, as the fictional idea of cyberspace, 
soon be concretisized by capitaloscene.

How to achieve tempolimit? they made it themselves,
by stucked in repairing and defending, trodden old Roman roads.
not effective anymore
investing in rail tracks, togetherness

battery eingefroren, smash the fog. 


<p>
Industrialization was already in full blow,
but physics still applied the laws
of classical mechanics to thermal engines
(stengers), together with fallacy that energy comes from nowhere,
(which is true, to some point), 
and merely drives the engine,
completely ignoring the driving force of energy, 
(which is unpredictable??)

water-mill gravity? 
as it is generally applied in mechanical closed systems, like person rides a bike. 
conservative thought of energy BUT exhaustion?? (subjective)

Entropy, ( a function chaos?? this is noise?), 
event (comes with noise)

in physics requires arrow of time,
the observer goes forward in time, entropy can encrease not decause,
entropy measurement, distinguish past from future
General thermodynamics irreversibilty, can increase not decrease!

Sadi Carnot, built upon his fathers work
was the first quantitave expression of irreversability ,
until it became a general formula of conservation.
conservation of energy and momentum=motion merely converted and transferred to other bodies
(stengers)

efficiency of heat machine, 
relies on the temperature exchange between energy and matter? (here heat difference)
avoid contact bodies having diff temp<but then dont work>

At all cost friction in mechanical machines to be avoided (stengers), 
avoid contact of cogs, moving at diff speed
only continous phenomena are conservative
otherwise loss of 'living' force, this mode of thought, 
infected the socio-political climate.

solution, isolate hot and cold, build isothermal change
BUT, theoretical, only concerned with balance the temp EFFECT of combustion
no brassier

Clausius, how to get back to initial state? need two source of heat

since the 18th cent, idealism has changed?
new science describe nature, including 'losses' (nothing is lost in nature?)

what is irreversibility?

the universe, or the positive absolute,
is neither about conservation or conversion
but creation and destruction, to produce difference. 

the mind works by dualism,
true diff in temperature, results in difference
but the effort of trying to balance, destroys difference

non-directional being is  diagrammed with the arrows of time (and space?)

artificial energy taken from flammable materials, 
seemingly abundant found in the depths of the earth, 
to be blown in the air.



struggle between thermod and dynamis, which stengers meaning of reality and time at stake.
Stengers, endorses one-way time?
transmittor, endless  (unknown) receivers (not anthropomorphic???? stengers)
cause

stengers favors dynamics plus the element of thermo
thermodynamics constructed by thought not experiment?


Entropy grows coz probability grows, expansion
great practical importance, no fundamental significance.
puts in relation entropy and probabilty actually only anthropo relation
neglegting irreversibality???

events unlikely to go backward, statistics ausschliessen?,
to measure unlikely events

conserved in the earth???, (water mill, gravity), 
ideal to run machine it is avoid bodies moving with diff speeds

thermodynamics, in heat engine avoid the contact of bodies with diff temp
scientists focus on efficiency of combustion,
energy conserve, but dissipation 


</p>

<p>
With the Copernican Revolution, the Occident discovered godless heliocentrism
and put a hot star at the centre of the universe,
which was previously the conductor, 
now downgraded to the mere measure, of all earthly things. 

This ideal monistic closed system, is doomed failure, thinking the absolute impossible?
more to this later.

The solar eclipse enabled the revenge of The Great Dictator, 
which bored crippled for life anthropocentrism, 
and brought about combustion engines, modelled after its creator,
intelligent design mirrored their bodies, 
give them breath by vital spark, 
and fueling the obscene consumption with non-degradable excretions.

Those served as a surrogate for cumbersome, meaningful debate with friends,
resulting in deafening silence.

The growing demand of , statistical information based on mechanism of control, 
cleansed the former much enlightening byproduct noise, 
hyperproduction of pure noise as in 
automated conversational customer service systems, 
interactive user-friendliness.

The ordinary sun dial promotes all work no play, 
a Telecracy (cybernetics), control to be useful for the ego.  



which Virilio calls the 'war of total mobilization' was
to construct "common collective conscience /memory"(133) 
based on "the cult of information"
(virilio,134)
which somehow erased the the root of evil, 
but capitaloscene
that led to the terror of assembly line, rail tracks

The symbol of classical mechanics is the clock,(stengers) a simple and honest viral meme, 
revealing only true time in materiality in its hidden mechanism,
a circle now infinite.

time qua experienced temporality? (202)
(202)Reza says, for analogue automaton AND non-analogical (language?) 
did we accept the same image of the neanderthal perception of time
into modern tensed language?

No human mind is prone of being tricked by the senses, 
observing its environment, 
even Newton believed in a single detatched, flowing river of time,
just like looking out the window of the backseat of a car, 
time appears, as if moving outside of us. 
unlike driving seat, when hopefully, present in the moment to see the full picture
rear mirror, the past different.

(203)For McTaggart time is not change, 
but stable events (durable molecular structures?Dawkins) in correlation? cause change?

The present is imagined not as a vanishing point but wave, 
there is before and after an event, ????

Environmental 'objects/events' ping on the senses,
observation does not correspond to
the present of the events observed
Scheingegenwart(204)
experience mere illusion, because restricted viewpoint(boltz 209)
space (up down), time (left right)


the mind itself, it is what it is,
create meta-narrative, thought model
cure meditation, focus on own body, true time which is not temporal


Space and time, each not satisfactorily defined,
to anonymous materials like heat
only applied "objective" characteristics, 
but as given dualism? (p.202)

all that exists/some existent things, (204). Reza favours this, reality qua experience???
(207)how is a priori act of experience fact, (if it is private and contingent?
(208) physics framework would crash, if revision to time
(209)Boltzmann: entropy can only go in one direction, 
later stage, earlier stage, 
"natural events will become ever more dull and uninteresting"
(210) irreversibility explained

engendered 

Memory leads us to believe that the past is known, <see paragraph on Mach> 
as can not objectively known, too many aspects in correlation to be fact
as memory itself is temporal awareness, which misleads us into
the unknown future? 

Future is anticipated by WILL?/body/, 
wich has absolutely no temporal understanding


------------------------------------
A crash reveals the 'alien order of time'[Land]
which is otherwise hidden, 
built-in in a accu e-smart, 
intelligent design of fate in 
classic car with combustion engine.

future trauma, with thermodynamics future is written, 
entropy increase to heat death


the fear and , uncertainty
lubricating the catalyst hyperstition
leaking on on the burning-hot engine to fan the flames .


It comes with the feature coincidence of short, 
entangled numerous cables occupied by current energy
no surprise, 
non-human readable machinic code, 
opening the conduit (kabelkanal), to become one with the energy.->death

superstitous folks, who put all their beliefs into the One main cable, 
push back in the engine space, as if nothing is happening, 

anticipate the crash, get off by stalling it (orgasm denial) 
they evoke it by evoking paranoia

but exploring the cultural meltdown, brought by unison of tech and body,
anticipate it, in order to fetishize the wounds and scars. 

 


Lyotard properly cuts the body open to find
the organic body of political economy occupied by
(2)"organized with survival", replacement of parts (not recration?)


Einstein rethinking of simultaneity, 
irreversible break
time and space.


The classics regard motion (time) as given, and only god knows why,
(new: make motion themselves)

Classical mechanics serves as the chassis of all theoretical physics, 
not only from historical progress
but unfortunately, has been universally internalized thought model, 
(boltz,38)


The geometrization project, Euclid, long break,
Aquina, Spinoza, Descartes
and then?
digital clock, algebra elimination technique, 

no time to waste thought about time, time itself became the clock.


Space or being are materials made of pure connexion, 
and it is hard work to disentangle all the cables
for what greater purpose? for third parties?


and there is only access to correlation, 
never to structural design (thought) and engine (being) on its own.


<p>
Absolute time is a quantum pulse of no purpose other than change, 
and is by all means not its task to detect consistency







And how the physicist being subject, 
if they do not even control their own bodies, 
and can only influence the exchange between system and environment 
blood pressure, function of organs, breathing etc.?
to balance it out
by third parties
and those objects, are capable of enhance or weaken the power of animal bodies?





the image of time, Grant big bang stones throw away. 
the science of thermodynamics, 
wants to show correlation (always subjective) and its variations of energy in systems, 
conservation
used for prediction and management in a controllable environment. 

McTaggart
The arrow of time
what Boltzmann said against A????

Time certainly comes from nowhere but by all means not from the past

the arrow of time suggests irreversibilty?
a progress, denies geometric round

Speculative Realism has problems with 'correlationism', 
the postmodern "reality engine"
firstly anthropocentric privilege of the observer over the observed
construe mind - world <b>relation</b>, as k'ant cognizant of 'things in themselves'
the fog of in-between, kan't see other cars, 
based on 'experience' (empiricism?), a limit.


As man of the hour, Ian Hamilton Grant, 
Grant advocates the Naturphilosoph, who inducted scientific knowledge into 
philosophical speculative systems, 
a drunk driving brought by generative power of the <i>absolute</i>(collapse, 39)

He proposes chemical thought model paradigm, supersede
predominant physics as a model of thought,
as it expands the empirical by the inert deep perspective of humans
and by doing so adds the true dimension of time.
and of surprise.
instead of rigid equatation

(41) production and analysis takes place in real time
no predict until synthesis

 recreation of nature
Georg Ernst Stahl from Ansbach

medicine about animal econonomy, 
chemistry more messy

bodies system mechanical, thermal and chemical action.
human made of, why the application of a mere static models
pressure, volume, chemical, temperature

the struggle of materialists vs vitalists is real,
first one matter and motion
electrical, life force, connected to soul

Thought's awareness of body's <i>Dasein</i> is 
solely based on sensual impression, 
thought, however is the idea of body,<small>[5]</small>
therefore the isolated sensing in conjunction with thought,
can neither be objective nor subjective,
as perception is provided by body, which in turn can not integrate in itself.
(spinoza)




<p>Total mobilization and motorization have always been two sides of the same coin in the race for biological and technological supremacy. Virilo (133)

the libinal 'body' is about creases, motion, environment

</p>

medicine works out animal economy. 
complexity of organs
chemistry isolated?
