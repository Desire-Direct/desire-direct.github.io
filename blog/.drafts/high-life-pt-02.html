Thought's awareness of body's <i>Dasein</i> is 
solely based on sensual impression, thought, 
however is the idea of body,<small>[5]</small>
therefore the isolated sensing in conjunction with thought,
can neither be objective nor subjective,

as perception is provided by body, 
which in turn can not integrate in itself.

Eating your own shit is taboo, explains Monte to the toddler 
and clarifies it by repeating and distorting the word, 
until it loses its analogue meaning to become a billowing bubble around them.
Freud wrote <i>Totem und Tabu</i> in a soulless past and
diagnoses everyone who doesn't tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness.

Neurosis is affect thinking which isnt in accordance with outer reality 
and his emotional writing on primitive savages, only proves this. 
at least he writes, that traits of stoneageman, resemble those of some modern man.


Totem is a universial social sculpture containing taboo, 


as modern man has lost the true Begriff, 
he discerns problems of translating the origin of taboo 
for Freud taboo the term is flat polarized,tendency to the forbidden

The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies the most savage, as they even don't know political leaders, 
is built upon the prevention of incestial behaviour, 
or mixing of of the same kind.

he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben 
shows parallels as Jung has found out that 
phantasy constructs of the devalued children of the earth, i.e.  
Geisteskranken (dementia preacox), 
conicide with the cosmogenics of savages, . 



His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

The blind toddler is in relation with 
Hume's problem of induction,
is it how to get clues without experience, general claims to predict the future, 
are overruled by the element of surprise, 
which is rationalized by hindsight,

Usually  chain (Schein) reasoning is the deduction 
from past observations of phenomena, 
which are true only in closed or Schein systems,
refuse relation to other systems. 


Hume's moral reasoning is not much different from that of Spinoza's Ethik,
which in spite of the terms, has nothing to do with any fake morals
it is reasoning about the god and the world

The film <i>High Life</i> points out the malfunctions of a <i>civil</i> engineered social health,
condensed onboard the cubicle ship, where  
happy togetherness is not only encouraged but enforced 
on  mad cogs, who are trained
optimized killer robots to fight a primitive war of all against all. 
In light of slowly approaching death, an overboiling passive aggression 
is radiated by those who swallow 
the toxic cocktail of sedating medication and
misdirected care, with the effect of becoming too dulled to be cured by emotional shock.

Boltzmann has to admit, that
theoretical physics is an efficient way to satisfy the practical
need of linear progress.
That is  to straighten and make an infinite end to the frightening eternal return,
from which, when thinking genuine and rational, there is no escape. 

It did not unhinge 
the free spinning mothership earth, but social order, 
reengineering of thought and as a result perception.

According to the news, he writes, hoary wifi is 
a modern discovery and identifies the 
mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, 
which sadly emerged as a soul-, instead of mind-crushing lever, 
as the starting point of ape developing human.(38)

Under the Second Law of Thermodynamics it is observered that hot matter is 
<i>universally</i> attracted by coldness
and with state-of-the-art technology, it becomes more and more difficult
to identify a cool replicant.

In the industrial age, humans applied machines with souls, 
cute machines, which mirror our bodies, including energy consumption and excretions.
Which served as a surrogate for
strenously meaningful communicating and vibing with our best friends isolated in the sunshine.

Boltzman concludes, if the world is mere phantasy sci-fi,  
wrong actions would have no consequences,
but as they do have, 
it is proof that there is an outside,
and right actions can only emerge from challenging the outside. (zweifel)
