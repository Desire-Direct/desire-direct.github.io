Modern theoretical physics is an efficient way to satisfy the male desire 
for linear progress, to speed on the data-Autobahn 
and to arrive quicker at destination sunset.
They don't know they built 
a boring secure, but dangerous ,negative feedback cycle, 
racing court(cern), so slick, non-profiled tyres. 

the obstacles of race, gender, nation have been removed
but obvs forgot 'class'


In truth, full life is a bumpy ride with obstacles, 
even seems in the spur-of-the-moment not easy, 
but makes the overall bumpy ride towards , long, pleasurable, sustainable.
With enough acceleration, not stopped by 
potholes filled by fluid ideas, as the fictional idea of cyberspace, 
soon be concretisized by capitaloscene.

To someone who is not happy with that, it appears to the eye on a planned diagram (meme)
as much slower, and as we will see time indeed slows down 
but quicker to proudly achieve smth.

the mind works by dualism,
true diff in temperature, results in difference
but the effort of trying to balance, destroys difference
Man-made tempolimit,
stucked by repairing and defending, trodden old Roman roads.
instead of investing in rail tracks, together enjoying landscape.

Classical mechanics serves as the chassis of all theoretical physics, 
but unfortunately, has been universally internalized thought model, 
(boltz,38)the socio-political climate.
as well as historical progress timeline, see below. 

The primitive technical achievements of ancient cultures,
invention of the wheel
having to deal merely with the lame earthly conditions of gravity.

Common sense of balance, that action stalled.
alerted cocky, armchair science, 
is looking down on true engineers, 
who tirelessly, work smart on hands-on "jugend forscht" projects.
Accustic and optics, all made subordinate to physics  (boltz 9)
stuff, that no emperical ground, organs, soul, the arts, ...under the domain of mechanics(26)
translated into waves, 
a kinetic character, which must to be seen by artificial means.
With the concretized application of analytical mechanics,
which are analogue laws of bodies in motion, 
it happened that bodies and minds did not move at all, and left it to machines (cars).

Boltzmann has to admit,
that even most complex algos, can not reproduce biological movement.(boltz, 27)
but maybe replicate?????

water-mill gravity? 
as it is generally applied in mechanical closed systems, like person rides a bike. 
conservative thought of energy BUT exhaustion?? (subjective)


The practical use of technology, is on contemplation a competitive need, 
a creative conflict, negotiated by cooperation with environment.

'erwachender Sinn fuer Technik' (39) (technology/nature abspaltung)
which sadly emerged as a round soul-, instead of developing to the edgy mind-crushing lever, 
for the need of food and shelter.
True invention by hand, thought of technology later. 

robot, speed, no work and play
Without explaining hoary, virtual technologies like X ray or tele-communications
Boltzman identifies the mechanical tool 'Knuettel', a bludgeon, 
that for from the human viewpoint, 
is either used murder or the patriotic accumlation of resources
as the starting point of ape developing human.(38-39)
</p>

<p>
(boltz 25)
The collective engineering of an utmost complex, refined motor, 
its laws as cogs in stock market traffic, lubricated
(boltz, 26)as the most important part of human traffic, 
as its mechanism regulates Mein und Dein, 
or the application of value upon inaccessable essence,
only ownership determines worthy live.
money, coin->air
Modern automatons turned Capital into a alien living organism killing millions, 
Is Capital a thermodynamic machine, which regulates human traffic
by hot car owners kill cool cyclists? 

battery eingefroren, smash the fog. (reza)
(boltz 27)
Ideas of things not identical with its essence, 
translated into images or numeric signs , algebra is a one sided "elemination technique"
but merely replicate correlations, whilst essence is not touched. 
Reasoning is deduction, not elimination of phenomena
instead of external train of thought, find on the wrong track, 
cars in traffic jam, due to accident of pushy and speeding science. 
[Boltzmann detects inauguration of progress, 
with pushy Newton applying Galilei laws on universe, 
instead of exploring earthly phenomena. (boltz,6) and Stengers]

events unlikely to go backward, statistics ausschliessen?,
to measure unlikely events


Industrialization was already in full blow,
but physics still applied the laws of classical mechanics to thermal engines
(stengers), 
together with fallacy that energy comes from nowhere,
which is true, to some point, 
Principal thing, machine is well lubricated and on fire. 

thermodynamics needs Kraftstoff,
hat sich dem Dualism zwischen Kraft und Stoff angeschlossen.
(Büchner, freedom), matter IS motion(33)


In machines the contact of cogs, moving at diff speed
needs to be avoided at all cost, otherwise damage of the gear box. 
thermodynamics
efficiency of heat machine, 
relies on the temperature exchange between energy and matter? (here heat difference)
avoid contact bodies having diff temp
Sadi Carnot, built upon his fathers work
was the first quantitave expression of irreversability ,
until it became a general formula of conservation.
conservation of energy and momentum=motion merely converted and transferred to other bodies
(stengers)


solution, isolate hot and cold, build isothermal change
BUT, theoretical, only concerned with balance the temp EFFECT of combustion
no brassier
Clausius, how to get back to initial state? need two source of heat

science efficiency of combustion
the problems of energiebeschaffung und abgas 
in conservative politics completely ignored.

ideal to run machine it is avoid bodies moving with diff speeds
thermodynamics, in heat engine avoid the contact of bodies with diff temp
</p>


<p>
With the Copernican Revolution, the Occident discovered godless heliocentrism
and put a hot star at the centre of the universe,
previously the conductor, now downgraded to the measurement, 
tachometer, kilometers per hour.
The solar eclipse enabled the revenge of The Great Dictator, 
which bored crippled for life anthropocentrism, 
and brought about combustion engines, modelled after its creator,
intelligent design mirrored their bodies, 
give them breath by vital spark, 
and fueling the obscene consumption with non-degradable excretions.

The ordinary sun dial promotes all work no play, 
a Telecracy (cybernetics), control to be useful for the ego.  
(40) marconi, news

Those served as a surrogate for cumbersome, meaningful debate with friends,
resulting in deafening silence.

The growing demand of statistical information based on mechanism of control, 
cleansed the former much enlightening byproduct noise, 
hyperproduction of pure noise as in automated conversational customer service systems, 
interactive user-friendliness.


Entropy grows coz probability grows, expansion
great practical importance, no fundamental significance.
puts in relation entropy and probabilty actually only anthropo relation
neglegting irreversibality???
Entropy, ( a function chaos?? this is noise?), 
event (comes with noise)
in physics requires arrow of time,
the observer goes forward in time, entropy can encrease not decause,
entropy measurement, distinguish past from future
General thermodynamics irreversibilty, can increase not decrease!

The universe,
is neither about conservation or conversion
but creation and destruction, to produce difference. 

struggle between thermo and dynamis, which stengers meaning of reality and time at stake.
Stengers, favours 
mechanics plus element of 
thermo,not own science.

</p>

<p>
the symbol of classical mechanics is the clock,(stengers) a simple and honest viral meme, 
flattened time
time is of no purpose other than change, 
and is by all means not its task to detect consistency.
the arrow of time
and to straighten and make an infinite end to the chaotic
eternal return, from which, when thinking genuine and rational, there is no escape.


time qua experienced temporality? (202)
(202)Reza says, for analogue automaton AND non-analogical (language?) 
did we accept the same image of the neanderthal perception of time
into modern tensed language?

No human mind is prone of being tricked by the senses, 
even Newton believed in a single detatched, flowing river of time,
just like looking out the window of the backseat of a car, 
time appears, as if moving outside of us. 
unlike driving seat, when hopefully, present in the moment to see the full picture
rear mirror, the past different.

(203)For McTaggart time is not change, 
but stable events (durable molecular structures?Dawkins) in correlation? cause change?

The present is imagined not as a vanishing point but wave, 
there is before and after an event, ????

Environmental 'objects/events' ping on the senses,
observation does not correspond to
the present of the events observed
Scheingegenwart(204)
experience mere illusion, because restricted viewpoint(boltz 209)
space (up down), time (left right)


the mind itself, it is what it is,
create meta-narrative, thought model
cure meditation, focus on own body, true time which is not temporal


Space and time, each not satisfactorily defined,
to anonymous materials like heat
only applied "objective" characteristics, 
but as given dualism? (p.202)

all that exists/some existent things, (204). Reza favours this, reality qua experience???
(207)how is a priori act of experience fact, (if it is private and contingent?
(208) physics framework would crash, if revision to time
(209)Boltzmann: entropy can only go in one direction, 
later stage, earlier stage, 
"natural events will become ever more dull and uninteresting"
(210) irreversibility explained


Memory leads us to believe that the past is known, <see paragraph on Mach> 
as can not objectively known, too many aspects in correlation to be fact
as memory itself is temporal awareness, which misleads us into
the unknown future? 

Future is anticipated by WILL?/body/, 
wich has absolutely no temporal understanding

And how the physicist being subject, 
if they do not even control their own bodies, 
and can only influence the exchange between system and environment 
blood pressure, function of organs, breathing etc.?
to balance it out
by third parties
and those objects, are capable of enhance or weaken the power of animal bodies?

the image of time, Grant big bang stones throw away. 
the science of thermodynamics, 
wants to show correlation (always subjective) and its variations of energy in systems, 
conservation
used for prediction and management in a controllable environment. 

McTaggart
The arrow of time
what Boltzmann said against A????

Time certainly comes from nowhere but by all means not from the past

the arrow of time suggests irreversibilty?
a progress, denies geometric round



<p>
A crash reveals the 'alien order of time'[Land]
which is otherwise hidden, 
built-in in a accu e-smart, 
intelligent design of fate in 
classic car with combustion engine.

future trauma, with thermodynamics future is written, 
entropy increase to heat death


the fear and , uncertainty
lubricating the catalyst hyperstition
leaking on on the burning-hot engine to fan the flames .


It comes with the feature coincidence of short, 
entangled numerous cables occupied by current energy
no surprise, 
non-human readable machinic code, 
opening the conduit (kabelkanal), to become one with the energy.->death

superstitous folks, who put all their beliefs into the One main cable, 
push back in the engine space, as if nothing is happening, 

anticipate the crash, get off by stalling it (orgasm denial) 
they evoke it by evoking paranoia

but exploring the cultural meltdown, brought by unison of tech and body,
anticipate it, in order to fetishize the wounds and scars. 

 


Lyotard properly cuts the body open to find
the organic body of political economy occupied by
(2)"organized with survival", replacement of parts (not recration?)




The classics regard motion (time) as given, and only god knows why,
(new: make motion themselves)


Space or being are materials made of pure connexion, 
and it is hard work to disentangle all the cables
for what greater purpose? for third parties?
and there is only access to correlation, 
never to structural design (thought) and engine (being) on its own.


Total mobilization and motorization have always been two sides of the same coin in the race for biological and technological supremacy. Virilo (133)
which Virilio calls the 'war of total mobilization' was
to construct "common collective conscience /memory"(133) 
based on "the cult of information"
(virilio,134)
which somehow erased the the root of evil, 
but capitaloscene
that led to the terror of assembly line, rail tracks
