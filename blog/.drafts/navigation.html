Contrary to popular belief, 
the <i>Big Bang</i> factually made it possible 
increasingly 
that light got scarce and the expanding universe holey.
Objects of massive gravity 

once sucked into there is no escape of 
internaising its imperial ideology of abstraction.




I love exploring the Outside without the aid of high tech and leave the mobile phone at home.bla
one which hasn't internet at all and the other under constant development.
Anyway questing it's better focusing on the movements environment, and relearn to trusting the senses, 
which I often felt deceived upon.


The enourmous silence, only to be interrupted by the great spotted woodpecker 
I feel safe in the former local Forest Sauvage  
and enjoy actually getting lost, knowing find the way back eventually in time.

A deliberate, conscious, constant de /reterritorialization
space becomes territory when it's incorporated in the mind, as they say

That's how I conquer foreign territory, the state border 
the quest, which led me to France in the summer of 2023.

it is good to discover big cities like parithes, in the manner of a flaneuse, 
to find extraordinary people and places, which aren't mapped and def not recommended in any tourist guide.

In Normandy, I got pretty lost once and sore feet, 
wandering endlessly in circles, while following misleading signs which didn't anything signify,
when walking from my base camp in st.aubin, where I've pitched my pavillion,  
to find the Radar facility in Douvres.
Signals to indicate that I was not welcome, me in the gestalt of Miss Bryant, fair hair 
mistaken me for a German spy, handed me the German brochure, which was useless
fell again to the promise of a young and handsome Canadian tour guide. 


But indeed I was sniffing the Radar station, no interest in their nazi memorabilia
the mirror deflection, from the sky




Anyway further interest in magnetism and gravity, knowledge which I will need for later projects.
puzzled by the waves inside of earth, which remains a conundrum, as outer space.


I got a (military) prismatic compass for a reasonable price, to practice navigation
and got a hiking map of 1:25000, as recommended in the video,
of 

that military compass, not for civilian use?
can be used as theodolite


What is magnetic declination? 


dEVIATION in degrees from direction shown on the map 
geographical north pole 
magnetic north pole

As above so below.european
Lodestone "course stone"
magnetite, is attracted my magnets but 
still puzzle, how lodestones become magnets themselves
by lighnting bolts.


durch den günstigen Verlauf der magnetischen Feldlinien in Bayern 
muss diese Abweichung zwishcen magnetischen un geographischer nordrichtung
bei praktischer Anwendung von topografischen Karten nicht berücksichtigt werden
