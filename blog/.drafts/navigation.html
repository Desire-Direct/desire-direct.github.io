The possibility to produce precise images
is refined by romantic goth Caspar David Friedrich.
Lit impressions of materiality 
simultaneously arise as stark phantasms and 
airy matter, which in gay naivite
are fleshed out with informal and outlining brushwork.
Friedrich is cryptographically expressing megalophobia 
and awe of a steady if unspectacular monstrous force nature,
which is carrying death threats out of the indifferent blue,
and thus pushes unappreciated background noise into perspective.
The recurring trope of sailing ships signals hope, 
but in vain: it mere echoes cries for consolation 
in a nightmare yet to unfold.

marvelling into a mirror to behold the fogged terror of their joint effort.

Rumour has it that Fichte prefers a crystalline <i>Wissenschaft</i>, 
to amorphous metaphysics,  

which would mean ascending to the bowels of <i>Rübezahl's</i> liar, 
finishing off the emotional tears in rain at the mountains of madness, 
where reason dissolves into muddy reality.

analyses phil as double-transcendental
when its  above its form 
(5-6)

Speleologists like Laruelle agree on the scientific method,
working along linguistically inside philosophy,
mining as many sparklers from emp(ty)irical rock strata as possible, 
and making impregnable, snug room within the body without organs (BwO).

Only the crystal ball of xenology offers
complex, yet ordered models of the world, 

the magical union of SF and formal logic,
the zooming in and out of knowledge, 
a trinity of transcendence, empiricism and the real.
relation not set theory.


without subjective sing interpretation of formal logic no objective?(291)


Laruelle is making good use of romantic vampyr Nietzsche, 
who is clearly dominating the object
by excessively penetrating bogged down philosophy, 
only to hurt himself in this transcendental double-bind relationship,
(soul and sense leaving out)
adn spinning with the Thing forever. 
Both exist as un-life subjects, 

Count Nietzsche is totally suicidal but not weary of life, 
just anancastically, theatrically  killing his ego, 
but not doing so, reboot, 
but he does not subscribe to the deadly force of capitalism,
and its purpose to eradicate all immortality from earth.

He is Rather sleeping in his coffin all day 
to avoid eyesight, empirical cancerous rays of the sun, 
and leaves all the proper jobs, 
which is the mere replication of <i>nature</i>.

Dr. Van Helsing refers to the Count as child-brain 
who after repeated reboot, with trial and error method
is taking up chances by half-thought, 
until its time to triumph, (Stoker, 362)

Hume's problem of induction,
is how to get clues without experience, general claims to predict the future, 
but are overruled by the element of surprise, 
which is rationalized by hindsight, 
the subconscious knew it all along,
a complete different pattern of experience.

Shariati, for whom the gravest tragedy of modernity

ggTerror excites identity, by concentrating it, and packaging

Where shall we begin/done? books like this all over the place,
but societal transformation lies in god's hand, 
and is rather "social strategy" (politics, lead to wrong actions) not ideology (religion/scientific theory)

Shariati speaks of "enlightened souls", 
and a good example is the the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing, 
best fiend of Count Dracula, (not enlightened? thus irresponsible) 
who just like him neither keeps a diary, nor writes lenghtly letters.
not into politics, bereichern?
As pitch light and bright dark can be, hang about 
 at the opposites borders of the unaware grey mass.
Van Helsing takes on responsibility to build a bridge,

prophet merging with the mass, (unlike revolutionary count?)

by help a static, frozen society to change direction, wherever that might be. 
social direction, cuddle up in the middle
not false prophets inflame their hearts giving direction. 
(white /dark, but stay in the twilight?)
revolutionary leaders not belong to educated class, warrior like Dracula, 
speak to emotions, drag em on the dark side.

No one questions his integrity, 
acts freely with his "pseudo-scientific" knowledge, which homes also the  occult,
smth which lingers beyond empirical.

even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic,
after the evil spirits left her corpse, rational, she's dead.
also very polite actor, inflame their hearts with kind- and gentleness, a new faith
(in themselves?)
is he Naturphilosoph, combines scientific practice with mental work, 

maternal instinct,
not by desire but unconsious drive, that their 
female identity, biological destiny
destiny is not to be imprisoned by children.

He is leading on a group of people, unable to form a logic of events on their own,
who are in doubt of what they've seen, can't make connection to the supernatural,
a mind-openener to empirical knowledge, building a bridge to the heart.
breaking their belief system, 
slowly!! teach them critical thinking by giving clues.
self-confidence /awareness

repeated observation must be so, 
bite marks at the neck,  vampyre incident
conscious what goes on, 
is felt, but not perceived. (soulless society)


The outsider as insider backs the right horse
not tossed down
by objective centripetal force of the vigilant, massive brain 
subjective centrifugal force thoughts are flying off

and in Dr(t)eamwork weaving solitary strings together 


This way the headless rider is torching the world of frozen language to
defends madness from getting sucked away by irresponsible coachmen, 
who insist to repeat in parrot-fashion a structure, 
to rein horse sense.

The Romantic movement is a spiritual reevalution of nature, 
and not a mere renaissance as in  romanticism, 
which tries to fix nature in the image of man. 
not prettify, like in ordinary arts
artisan, perfection his craft

(fuller, 33)
aisthesis is about sensing and sense-making,
two different kinds, in relation
even so fraught with tension, even so far to kill each other(34).

each experience not form but constitute it 
(thinking process killed, and make another?)
sensing entity, sense-making process (matter and code)

incompatible, combining multiple views from WITHIN.
many agree on what have sensed, democracy.

By entrusting human remains to the transience of a canvas,
Friedrich's paintings invigorate shudders 
unforeseen occurance of catastrophe.

(35)sense-making does not appeal to a universal a priori knowledge
world view, many knowledge, reasoning in terms of many kinds
and times?
sense-making of complex systems? like economy, 
not simply price, 
different from bats.


(34) construction of sense-making
technology
deceived accuracy of instrument


The ephemeral soul of the Vampyre does not reflect in a mirror
and out of despair he smashes it,


not organism of constant? 
the subjective, 
soul in the eyes
f what can not be painted, 
inversion
making himself a revolutionary within the struggle itself
self-hatred?


reality sculpting from within.
self-sculpting, inhuman form not transcendence
embodies the immortal soul

<i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), 
IMHO a faithful, parasitic representation of the novel,
shows a portrait of the unpolluted Count,
which resembles the famous work 
of renaissance man Albrecht Dürer,
who mastered the art of painting
on the climax of youth, 
who turned to  maturity of the millenium.

The rebirth of the classical age,  
the sculptures of ideal bodies, proportions
golden ratio.

previously he shys away from the confrontion with his 
face,
which give reflection of light, alive (woke)
in a ()hole, like schizo Descartes on century later?

blending out world around him
(Batty, subject never dies, mind can't cope mortality)
sensual bouche, framed by striking hair and fur, hand
the false construct of the I

and he merged most possible self in one image, 
the immortal dead ones, future ones?
or the experience, improved painting?

mortals can see themselves, 
in all their balance of power and weakness, 
if disturbed, narcissism or lack of confidence,                                                                     

The Wampyr eats you from the inside, 
alive, and keeps you un-live.
once a fatty from nourishing blood, 
the thin white Count, 
although always been only a shadow of himself


with the metal movable type revolution
and despite in the middle age where we shall begin?


The master of bats, rats and  wolves envelops the void under his cape, 
but is prisoner by the very same
opens it, to gives off a whiff of contaminated air,
miasma, to do their deed
Herzog  shows empathy for the soulless Count, 
as the absence of love is the most abject pain, 
and gives Nosferatu a stable soul in shape of Klaus Kinski.

the enforcement of involuntary monogamy, 
skin-deep relations produce,
alienation between man and woman,(421)
but also their own feelings and bodies, 

"prescribed closeness" with "the one", 
exactly, a growing hatred of women in general.


Of the oppressed rights to generally heighten them in public, 
but privately fuck em in the toilet in private.

such as English rose *unfuckable* Lucy, 
who wants to love all her admirers,
blood transfusion on her deathbed,
in absence of her cuckold groom Arthur. 

[in this chapter drawing heavily on Sittengeschicht by Fuchs.]


The nouveau riche intruding the royal courts, 
is a pain in the arse for the poor nobility,
to differentiate from working class, only by means of capital and

with their BFF, sweet-tempered Mina and Lucy exchange of letters
in a pleasant language, showering each other with compliments but
zombie brains, but their romantic affairs.

In the simulation,
With cybersex in the libidinal economy, 
men and women must only provide to platforms, 
desire inseparable with Capital. 
women present their fertile eggs, and men 
spray semen over the www.
efficient, cowardly way , no time for dating,
intellecuteal peasants, where women are nothing but cattle, lifestock 
animal husbandry as lucrative business model. 
in the game of power.

evolution can not go backwards, as there never been
only metamorphosis.

Human mimicks the animal, language prey,
more attractive with masquerade for the opposite gay sex, 

to exaggerate their sexual characteristics,
but pressured into of what the market, not the better half wanted, 
fashion industr, 
gross perfume over pleasant smell of ballsacks and cunts,
powdering the pale skin, tanning
the 70s , then the removal of body hair.  
as chemistry can not be trusted.
now norm clothing, or naked, simple like bacteria. 


Women are pigeonholed to be gifted by soft skills, 
to make perfect socialites, 
and are sentenced to toxic work at vanity fair
the benefactor, however, 
freed from easy social work,
hard science of power games in solitude.

insatiable nymphomaniacs for other men, 
substitute for concrete women, unloved tragic figures, can't find love, hate them?

death drive  literally power over sex, control life

and the only the cure for the mental illness romantic love is death,
but not as much as the deeply desired but feared encounter with the opposite sex.

Luciana:

he un-dead come to be alive by the exchange blood not sperm, 
but this has only to do with male model of pleasure,
coz of binary 1 and 0, of collision and repulsion.


binarism of sex
it always want what you can't have,
to fill lack with penis, 
which is already in abundance void vagina.


Luciana propose a third way (4), between (dis)embodiement
a wild "information trading" across sex, animals and machines,(bacterial?)
without coming. (the vampyre, who cant petite mort)
or the collective power of conatus?(32)
only collsion that makes mutation
repulsion not poss, coz anyway connected somehow
merging into a new body while destroying another, Zellteilung???



Aufklärung is the impossible act of deterriolization,
mind reteritorialized to virtual reality.(in-between?)



autoeroticism is better, 
a good mindfuck, 

no dealing with the Other, there are no limits to the imagination, 
hard work, nothing holds us back,
no risks of heartbreak??
absence of corporeal presence reinforces male pleasure(2, Luciana)
economy of pleasure
The desire towards discharge, the drive for extinction.


no male/female transit needed, (communication) 
violence 

romantic sex is a revolt against god (christian).
magnetism, that pushes and holds bodies together, 
the relation is glued together by a child?

focus is put on "exitement"?(nietzsche?)
abstract sex has infected the body. (Dracula?)


Ceasing corporeal difference, 
everyone trans,let it all hang out, gender swap, s/m
In this experimental playground, erase past and future image of the human.
the inhuman has no identity at all, other than changing one.

Bodies become undistinguishable, conform to what sells best,
and exaggerated gender features, 
the role, sex doll, meat puppets without brains.

Hoes are existing, sex with or without money.
Freeing sex from its biological function,
did not liberate women, but made them hoes.



ape is understanding things by observation, but does not know. 
parallel language developed 
a desire for understanding (cells??)



Lucy choose Lord, marry rich however you wont be loved.(as in columbia movie)
and goes from virgin straight to hooker, 
adultery later. 
and to remain an empty vessel, to be filled with children, 
men in favour to maintain the claim to power of totally unbothered genes, 
rather sociality.
what monsters does this produce, in the name of random nature?
unnatural particpants, nuptial
Hybrids, which are sterile, (true Nature)

Dr. Dibs, is infertile like the modern prometheus, dies by her own hand,
who failed and killed her family, 
then vitro fertilization, to create a perfect family, fail -> death.
The ghouls, plundering dead people for lumps of rotting flesh, semen,
for the good of humanity.
The plague as purge/putrification (verfaulen) process?


saliva infect each other, peopling by reproduction?

Both Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922)

place great emphasis on the symptom of mass hysteria,

The body rebels (19) performs exorcism to (20) discharge its internal rottenness, 
Freudian slips,
Both are aesthetically very pleasing, 
to manipulate emotions, atmospheric of fear.

Appearance of Schreck, very shocking for audience, 
 whilst the former, 
antisemitic undercurrent a fear of east-european jews, steal your wife
take over homeland. 
(soldiers, the makers, schreck, pts, murnau also ww1, grau death drive)

the latter, 
critique of capitalism, bourgeousie?


Do all 'evil' emotions originate in sex? 
like esteem and scorn (descartes)
yes, ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.

instead of dignity of their slaughter victims, 
make the enemy  smaller, vermin
tainted with condescension


disease-causing agent
The contagion, placeholder for the unexplicable in-between 1 and 0.

When confronted with (im)mortality, 
humans can steal away from responsiblilty, 
or, the burden of representation. coat, underneath void.

which means the extinction of a whole species, in favour of vampyre existance.

Artaud speaks of the Black Death as  psychic entity, 
a pseudoplague as a symptom for
the sudden occurence coincide with grave socio-political change,
as  previous stable social structures dissolve 
rats devour the smelly streams of rotten flesh,

everlasting modern nightmare of a global protractive war, 
no climax in the Western hemisphere, only die local.

Only the body has clarity of certain death, the mind ousted to believe,
belief system
or utter madness,  
the disease enables free will, suppressing reason (although era of reason)
which shows as "die Sau rauslassen",  
and perform necrophil acts without any beneficial use 
and the theater is born.(24)


<p>To break through language in order to touch life is to create or recreate the theater; ~Antonin Artaud</p>



(21)
plague affects brains and lungs, 
function, we can consciously manipulate through the mind. 


(23) rather spectacle? panic in towns ,no toilet paper
explosion of deaths. 

(24) victim who dies without material destruction, stigma of abstract disease upoin him 
similar to an actor, 
penetrated by his role. 
(reaction although nothing has happened, coz simulation and the body is still the same)
has visions. 

(25) the plague means change, opportunity to play another role. 
physical disorganization
parasite, noise


however, less energy needed for an actor than true murderer?
murderes fury exhausts itlef, (open systmen)

(26)without killing, provokes most mysterious alterations not only individual

As man of the better part of the hour, Ian Hamilton Grant 
advocates the Naturphilosophen, 



who inducted? scientific knowledge into  philosophical speculative systems.

The old school producing knowledge, also from within?
new skool, hates the abyss of Absolute, 
does not understand it, wants a full picture 
nuke it, lightning flash, a mere glimpse of history
new world,
which pulls science further from clarity to obscurity.



Lem's planet Solaris displays endless phenomena, 
"the void of the Absolute"[Grant]

portrays human xenophobia towards the brutal honest ocean,
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, 
in order to get sane response.  (failed communication)
and cut short illuminates new features, 
changes the whole thing, but only to the eyes. 

potent ocean, to grow with the potentialities of the ocean
instead of bombing it, man-made evolution.
the bomb is real


Grant:
The Absolute is metamorphosis, 
actual change cannot be observed, when in it. 
only alteration.

Y2K true. 

double-mirror inside brain.

Dracula abhors the mirror, 
no reflection, coz hes change. 

Dorian Gray  
spirit face imperceptible alters 
surface does not change.
only alteration is development, real
behind 
the outside clasping movement of capital, turning against it


although he embodies change, he does not alter,



Grant asks, 
The grey zone, twilight, fog 
conqer with black, or illume from within? yup

Dracula dies exposed in the light, 
pumping light into him not. 

What if Dr. Frankenstein finds a Xray from the future in his lab, 
would it change his practice?

Stoker's Dracula are written accounts of folk tales 
an adapted version for the perverted modern society.

Herzog says foreshadowed the communication age, integrates state-of-the art technology, 
the entries are solitary (cybernetic), 
but actions condition each other (mutation?).
Mina transcribes Dr Sewards spoken diary,
full of soul she says, and makes it immediately common and banal. (Serres)
The theory of communication treats the sign as mere message
floating above the coherent fleshly material.
from pheremonlogy to phonology.

Lyotard (42-43)
Signs substitute, to navigate in the void of unknown matter, or space, 
into the hard coded signs of language.
and Meaning is generated because there is difference from other signs.

traditional:
Message replaces information, 
sign replaces what it signifies
sign simultaneously announces and conceals (women on screen),
now nothing to conceal.

the emptiness between difference, 
relation needs to be established.
contact with alien thru language.

The articulation of the flesh, 
the limitless, futile sorting into individual parts,
forget about relation,
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable
moods, flavours and odours, all unmeasurable qualities 
that are not the same for everyone.

the coded sign, no more metaphor, or individual interpretation
subject has both encryption keys, public and private.
now only public key left,
smothered by a public identity or global 'us-ness', engineered by state.

The revision of rules, (relation), 
immutable blockchain,
rules that cannot decyphered.
interminable exchange machine, whiff of air.

nothing new, or original between sender and receiver,
as determined, a priori knowledge, 
and the sign is now based on signification alone,
detached from underlying flesh.

Modernity doesn't require knowledge, 
even monkeys can sort things
as long it understands the formula of success-ion, 
without the Absolute, the effective.

Lem (75), humans don't want to conquer the cosmos,

structured experiments with flies and spiders in the lunatic asylum,
aimed to prove how the stronger eats the weaker. 
and sees no problem in taking lives, but feels guilty, 
when it dawns upon him of taking souls.


Rituals against the lack of order
This approach is taken up by Freud, 
who built his thesis around <i>Totem und Tabu</i> 
on the generalization of race, ethnogeny, (Rassenkunde), 
in soulless times and
diagnoses everyone who does not tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<small>[]</small>

correctly he writes madness originates in thought 
and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
the latter has been totally disturbed by the former.


The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
(smth doesn't belong in here?
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
nO defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.


The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most unpleasant and retarded, 
as they shockingly neither idolize false prophets nor
sexual morality, but survive in the most hostile environment, 
is built around the firm prevention of incestial behaviour, 
or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 





connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without Freud German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.

modernity and neurosis has defeated Germany
which just as Europe has no common culture
tribes patched together, territory in central Europe, 




he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) and 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben, 
a template of pattern, on which we practice further knowledge
not just copy the prescribed, or decorate with ornaments 
but radical new forms, by remaining sceptic, aware and suspicious.

Jung, found out that 
phantasy constructs, of the devalued children of the earth, e.g. 
Geisteskranke (dementia preacox) , conicide with the cosmogenics of primitives. 
Renfield, slave to master Dracula.

[1] Roy Batty
[] Neurosis is affect thinking, which does not vibe in accordance with reality 
and his passionate writing on primitives only proves his point.
