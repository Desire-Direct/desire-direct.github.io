Catapulted into outer space, the future is televized 
to a based life light years from the past.
"Eating your own shit is taboo", explains Monte to the toddler 

and performs the itarate distortion of the hollowed word,
to deterritorialize analogous signs,
and  
the equivocal filling 
of a billowing, nourishing bubble around them.


In times of gravitational change, 
the headless rider is torching the world of frozen language 
and defends madness by
trusting the centripetal force of the vigilant, massive brain,
which prevents from getting tossed down.

The groundless fear of irresponsible coachmen, 
who think that thoughts fly off by centrifugal force

and replace saddle soul with the 
presumably comfy, wooden carriage of <i>Dasein</i>, 
and insist to repeat in parrot-fashion <i>H&uuml; und Hott</i>, 
to rein horse sense and never factual progress.
patches a pattern in learnt hierarchical axioms
stays empty subject.


Correlationism is bs 
what other than thought, would make 

according to Spinoza, who writes
that the body is recognized 
only by the idea of <i>Affektionen</i>, p. 50,
and as a product of the soul,
thought is the body in expansion, lehrsatz 19,  


interpreter soul, which transcribes 
machine language 
into comprehensible human-readable form, 'natural language'

Behind the screen is a black hole, 
which projects and absorbs the subject into matrix, 

or the anthropomorhic signified of the object.


body is abstract sign, 


there is no access to body and thought apart from one another,
outside??




On the other hand, the sensing of objects and making therof 
must be kept seperate and in tension,<small>[]</small>
as what appears on the surface, is but a product of mere human illusion, 
 which deserves close attention 
and a speculation for different realistic features.


Sense-making is knowledge production, 
which does not appeal to universal a priori knowledge(35),
and addresses Hume's problem of induction, 
or how to get clues without experience, 
by the playful inhuman instinct to play like a child. 

A child not learnt language decently is unable to form own thought,
and stays primitive, like self-harming Kaspar Hauser.

Cohesive bodies experience encounters of the third kind, 
or in other words the Other, 
through the framework of language, 
which is structuring spatio-temporal thought, 
or god's code to navigate in a uniform void of gray matter.
(proof god exists)


the side of sense-making and hypotenuse endless long, 
knowledge is restricted to appearances

the object is what it is


mind forms object, structures reality independently, 
nothing we can do about, but change lingo?
rather other way around, but no good


(295, reza),


(291) generalized paedogy, lack of methods,  is the problem with AGI.
Claims of nonlinguistic thought, dubious 
(Reza, 296).
in other words a realized language that is recognized,
and magically 'understood' by human clones of automata,
or 
decyphered by the spiritual physiognomy of the body?

"Cybergothic, the subculture of the enlightenment, is celebrating otherness 
by throwing shadows on the Cathedral ruin, 
what is my shadow here is my true substance." ~ cute count<small>[1]</small>
</p>

<p>
The possibility to produce precise images
is refined by cybergoth Caspar David Friedrich.
Lit impressions of materiality 
simultaneously arise as stark phantasms and 
airy matter, which in gay naivite
are fleshed out with informal and startling brushwork.
Friedrich is cryptographically expressing megalophobia 
and awe of a steady if (un)spectacular monstrous force nature,
which is carrying death threats out of the indifferent blue
and thus pushes unappreciated background noise into perspective.
The recurring trope of sailing ships signals hope, 
but in vain: it mere echoes cries for consolation 
in a nightmare yet to unfold. 
In formation with tiny humans, 
the inverter is turning his back at industrialization, 
painting veracious potraits of contemplating objects in grave solitude, 
marvelling into a mirror to behold the fogged terror of their joint effort.
Here, the <i>figurative</i> mind 
stands not in opposition to <i>abstract</i> nature, 
performing inadequate and pointless acts 
to generate brilliant works of degenerate art through alien technology, such as bygone <i>Human</i>,
which are declared by morbid binary methods as absolutely pathological.
A desired world is a reflection of the hopeless attempt 
to avoid grave mistakes of a thoughtless nature, 
yet, by all appearances a revision of incomprehensible death 
and not a waste of endless possibilities,
as extravagance of reasonable craft is pursued after finitude of free will.<small>[2]</small>
By entrusting immortal human remains to the transcience of a canvas,
Friedrich's paintings visualize the vicious transparency of time
through speculative realism. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), 
IMHO a faithful, parasitic representation of the novel,
shows a portrait of the (un)polluted count,
which resembles the famous selfie of Albrecht D&uuml;rer,
who mastered the craft of painting at the climax of youth.
D&uuml;rer's montage of most advanteageous self-improvement 
hailed the rebirth of the classical age at the turn of the century 
with a celebration of hedonistic bodies in anticipation of a 
lopsided golden ratio and the engineering of ideal sameness.

Adjacent to the right angle and opposite to laborious self-love, 
lies the prolongated, pleasant side of aesthetics, 
and arouses a reactionary passive gaze at the sensual bouche 
of the false prophet, 
which defers a proactive engagement with a work of art.
<object data="/file.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

The photorealistic display of the posthuman subject in deadlock
touts merely one future, present in D&uuml;rer's portrayals of a wretched mother.

On the other hand, 
the representational character of the object is of utter importance,
as only shallow people make nothing of appearance,<small>[]</small> 
since but a poor sense-making projects to the mirror,
and out of despair the self-hatred vampyr smashes it, 
and aspires for perilious revolution
at the outside, instead facing the struggle within.

The poetic, isosceles triangle of sense and sense-making 
conflates into a platonic line of Sarco pods, 
which marks the absence of a collective aesthetics in fascist rhetorics, 
and not ever will make alternative sense.


Where shall we begin? Maybe with the metal movable-type revolution?
Shariati senses the gravest tragedy of modernity
in the existing widening gap of eductated - uneducated,
which were closely bonded through a dissolving RGB ideology.
Politics benefits massively from such opportunity and
even cries out for antiquated educational reforms to allow
lingering pleasure-seekers in neutral grayscale.
Without substance, master capitalism
can not even throw a shadowy narrative to the server and 
domains of infinite complexity, such as <i>Wirtschaft</i>,
are compressed into the falsity of a simple slogan, 
that by power of perversion feels pleasantly always to be true.<br>
The jobs of alien hilya are increasingly taken away by national psyche!<br>
Lies!
</p>

<p>
Such ubiquitous sensing incidents are the immediate-attack-defence tactics 
of hollow, and therefore, malicious chatbots,<small>[plato]</small> 
which hold only one message in storage that is proudly announced, 
to worm into literal, uniform mass sense-production.<small>[lyotard]</small>
At the same time, illiterate subjects 
are helpless in dealing with the cryptic mess around objects, 
and indignantly conceal for them unavailable, valuable information.

The momentous reference of poor <i>Wirtschaftswachstum</i> 
which BTW never raised any proletarian,
is the only information the addressee, a spoilt working class, gets, 
but without access to decent coding, or in other words signification,
it is unable to work out the untouched, healthy fact, 
that fat cats require strict diets, and thus postponed to infinity. 


Convenient to share a public profile or global 'us-ness', 
but the neglected private object is missing signified transaction and 
hails the general solution engineered by capitalsim, 
which is to abduct its very own future. 
for a rapid progress of terminal cancer. 

Among us! obsessives, a blaring gray minority, 
which under the cloak of democracy,
vent self-hate on imposters, who are vigorously expanding objects, 
in brutally silence the majority of POCs and switch them off.



Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922), a <i>beautiful</i>, 
extraordinary, so-called silent, shadow play,
holds the most effective weapon for emotional manipulation. 
Warmachines, fallen ill from blindsight and not capable of any reflection 
within the hideous, big-nosed grimace of Schreck, 
low frequencies are brought into play to 
hit the body and transport the antisemitic undercurrent 
unmediated into thought, which creates a 
somber mood against the gay Eastern Jew, who understandably 
is <i>stealing</i> <i>your</i> wife and taking over homeland.<small>[]</small>
Both applauding audience and makers of the film 
just experienced the unimaginable terrors
of logistical warfare, but nevertheless, reject challenging therapy and 
get from quacks easily what they want; 
the prescription for the blue pill, 
a drug aimed to treat only the painful symptoms of PTSD, which is 
blatantly advertised to gain 
stiffness and quick recovery for a retour to business as usual, 
instead of rooting out the cause with the hard to swallow red pill,<small>[]</small> 
to which the West prefers to stay blind.


<p><i>There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.</i> ~ Count Dracula
</p>

<p>
AFAIK, rumour has it, that Fichte prefers a crystalline <i>Wissenschaft</i>, 
to amorphous metaphysics, which might mean the ascent outside 
the bowels of <i>R&uuml;bezahl's</i> liar, 
and finish off the emotional tears in rain at the mountains of madness, 
from where reason drops onto muddy reality.<small>[]</small> 

Speleologists like Laruelle agree on the scientific method
but avoid the deadly peril of pushy phallic mining, 
rather gaming away linguistically and 
collecting as many sparklers from surfacing emp(ty)irical rock strata as possible, 
and making impregnable, snug room within the body without organs (BwO).

Practicing xenology inside the crystal ball of philosophy allows for
a physical and spiritual withdrawal from an isolated idea of realism and
invoking the triangular trade of empiricism, transcendence and the real.

with the unexplicable method of rejection of premature understanding 
by persistant zooming in and out of knowledge, 
combination of SF and formal logic,
complex, yet ordered models of the world.

elements rest not, overruled by the matter of surprise, 
tremor
which rationalized by hindsight, 
the subconscious knew it all along heard through belly rumble, 
falling rock
establishing a complete different pattern of experience.


Laruelle is making good use of romantic vampyr Nietzsche, 
who is clearly dominating the un-life subject
by excessively penetrating the bogged down, recalitrant object, 
only to hurt himself being with a transcendental double-bind relationship,
to spin with the Thing forever. 
(5-6)
instead of unify.

</p>


<p>
From the perspective of gray matter, it appears as if Dracula and Van Helsing, 
as pitch-light and bright-dark can be, 
hang about at the opposite sides of a labile society.
In truth however both are deep inside, 
but whilst the former illuminates the way 
outwards from the middle to the right direction, 
the latter suggests a continuance somewhat in the twilight,
and is teaching critical (un)thinking to guide a doubtful group of solitary people, 
who are unable to form a logic of suspicious events on their own.

By vigour of instinct, the experimental dance on the icy surface
accumulates weight to break a frozen belief system and
unites what thought incompatible, which most can agree on.
Van Helsing cures blindsight
by building a bridge to the heart and simultaneously burns it, 
to embold a swim for life in tempestuous, literate flesh, 
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable qualities of moods, flavours and odours.
Now, equipped with multifocal insight and bold confidence,
the empirical understanding of bite marks, 
combined with the supernatural knowledge of the real, 
is openening the previously unimaginable transcendental triangle of aesthetics.

After inflaming hearts, no one questions the integrity of the vampire slayer,
who freely practices the dark art of <i>pseudo-science</i>,
even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic,

the rat understands, that all evil spirits had left the corpse,
just to make sure it is really dead.
