<p>There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand. ~ Count Dracula
</p>

<p>
Stoker's Dracula is a folk tale
which raises awareness of the hypocritical society, 
where nobody wants to acknowledge the truth. 
Featuring a group of people, unable to form a logic of events on their own?

Science alone is helpless, 
Dr Seward
"only to improve and conserve the miserable condition of Lucy, not letting her die",  

The epistolary novel <i>Dracula</i> gives reality to the events,

Werner Herzog cunningly disses Stoker for his mediocre writing, 
which only mirrors his own authentic, childlike style and dark humour. 

He shows empathy for the soulless Count, 
as the absence of love is the most abject pain, 
and gives him a soul in the shape of Klaus Kinski,

is a portrait of what can not be painted, 



The Gothic, subculture of the enlightenment,
neither hides the ugly truth and sublime beauty,
stands for transgression, marginality, 'otherness',
occult, and allies with the monster. 


Humans ability to make an image of nature, 
skillfully painted in humouresqe metaphors
by goths like Caspar David Friedrich, who displayed humans 
from behind, facing nature like in mirror, 
the terrors nature.

The Count is more a threat to the inside, 
and gives off a whiff of contiminated air 
although he embodies change, he does not alter. 

The master of bats, rats and  wolves hides a full void under his cape, 
but to keep it real, he reterritorializes earth to the West.
groundless science. 
he un-dead come to be alive by the  exchange of body fluids, 
saliva infect, blood nourish


similar to Dorian Gray, 
who does not alter in the mirror, 
his understanding of the world surely grows,
expertise of manipulation,
whilst his soul fades over time. 
whilst his knowledge of the body/soul worsens?

The invisible but perceptible soul, 
ephemeral air grounded in truth, 
envelopes the abyss with his cape.

The Count sleeps in his coffin all day, 
leaves all the real production to nature [real production, rare, improbable, Serres]
overflowing with information, 
leaves the scraps to the parasites.
On night shift

the self-destructing sadist, 
which is from a wider perspective the victim.

</p>

<p>
Shariati speaks about "enlightened souls", 
and a good example is the the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing, 
who just like the Count neither diary entry, nor writes lenghtly letters,
and is as unpolitical, ideology-free, 
mere battle of light and dark, stand out of the unaware grey mass.

No one questions his integrity, 
acts freely with his pseudo-scientific knowledge.
even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic,
after the evil spirits left her corpse. 

Van Helsing opens the eyes. 
empirical knowledge, beyond cognition. 

He takes on social responsibility,
who helps a static, frozen society to change direction, 
towards opening soul and senses and unify with mind. 


He teaches "self-awareness",
who are in doubt of the supernatural what they've seen,
and feelings.
slowly teach them critical thinking by giving clues
not false prophets inflame their hearts giving direction.

Raw, violent sex has been softened by cultural code,
getting to know each other, dating a ritual of modernity,
a romanticized business deal, to provide safety.
smelling the fear in the pheromones, chemistry?
to be abstract sex.
rather lifelong marriage with idiot. 

Freeing sex from its biological function,
did not liberate women, but made them hoes.

The social church
Descartes, passions of the soul (emotions),
like esteem and scorn
do all evil emotions originate in sex? 
yes, ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.
cybersex, prosthetic extension


from need to desire of sex?

Men fear, but deeply needed encounter with the opposite sex.
blame them for their weakness, sadistic, scapegoat women, jews.
instead of dignity of their slaughter victims, 
make the enemy  smaller, vermin
tainted with condescension



In the simulation,
With cybersex in the libidinal economy, 
men and women must only provide to platforms, 
desire inseparable with Capital. 
women present their fertile eggs, and men 
spray semen over the www.
efficient, cowardly way , no time for dating,

We all know that self-satisfaction is always better, 
no dealing with the Other, there are no limits to the imagination,

romantic sex is a revolt against god (christian).

abstract sex has infected the body. (Dracula?)


Ceasing corporeal difference, 
everyone trans,let it all hang out, gender swap, s/m
In this experimental playground, erase past and future image of the human.
the inhuman has no identity at all, other than changing one.

Bodies become undistinguishable, conform to what sells best,
and exaggerated gender features, 
the role, sex doll, meat puppets without brains.

Women hoes do exist, just like man, 
without maternal instinct,
not by desire but unconsious drive, that their 
destiny is not to be imprisoned by children.
female identity, biological destiny

Simliar to 
Dr Dibs, like the modern prometheus, who failed and killed her family, 
then vitro fertilization, perfect, 
Frankenstein wants to create, which kills his family. 

The ghouls, plundering dead people for lumps of rotting flesh
for the good of humanity.


Dracula makes female vampyres his bitches, makes them sluts

Brenfield??

<p>
is rational subconscious
turned inside out
anthropomorphized
is the true inhuman hero.


Fleeing in to ice, cold, no fame in the circus,
all he wants is seeking a humble life with a wretched mate,
never find acceptance by human.
On the other hand we have the man-made wretch,
brute outer appearance, masks his inner, powerful strength, 
eager to gain knowledge about human nature, which it does not understand.

The monster is possessed by true intelligence, 
and in his defence, he does not want to destroy the outside world, 
but fake construes. 

Intelligence is the ability to establish contact
among different lifeforms, well versed to communicate with the alien,
unanswered, unimportant bat.
It converses fluently with the materiality of the brain to produce thought,
a function, that can not be captured by the mind.

Structured language, tame thought

The rag rug of dead matter, is a BwO, hardware
bodies of soft- and wetness, which continously move and deform, 
messy streams of blood, turned 
visceral (die Eingeweide betreffend)

The modern prometheus, advanced magic =technology
the world, metamorphosis
into the evolution of a technical object.


Fichte wants a clear philosophy, a Wissenschaft, 
rather than the swindle (Wissens) form of metaphysics,
a stony evolution rather muddy metamorphosis.

ex hypothesi he says, 
actor and object has to be one, otherwise subject.
and says the character of reason 
object exists only within a person /time/ego?
the inner soul is dark, only actions /language can be observed.

making language a subject to science,
stripping away the vital part of what once defined human.  


blame tech, is only distraction globalised capitalism


Under the approach for the greater good,
subjective goals, desire. 
ability to speak, regulation so language is autopoesis?


As man of the different hour, Ian Hamilton Grant 
advocates the Naturphilosophen, 
who inducted scientific knowledge into  philosophical speculative systems.

The old school producing knowledge, from within.
new skool, hates the abyss of Absolute, 
does not understand it, wants a full picture 
nuke it, lightning flash, a mere glimpse of history
new world,
which pulls science further from clarity to obscurity.



Lem's planet Solaris displays endless phenomena, 
"the void of the Absolute"[Grant]

portrays human xenophobia towards the brutal honest ocean,
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, 
in order to get sane response.  (failed communication)
and cut short illuminates new features, 
changes the whole thing, but only to the eyes. 

potent ocean, to grow with the potentialities of the ocean
instead of bombing it, man-made evolution.
the bomb is real


Grant:
The Absolute is metamorphosis, 
actual change cannot be observed, when in it. 
only alteration.

Y2K true. 

double-mirror inside brain.

Dracula abhors the mirror, 
no reflection, coz hes change. 

Dorian Gray  
spirit face imperceptible alters 
surface does not change.
only alteration is development, real
behind 
the outside clasping movement of capital, turning against it

Grant asks, 
The grey zone, twilight, fog 
conqer with black, or illume from within? yup

Dracula dies exposed in the light, 
pumping light into him not. 

What if Dr. Frankenstein finds a Xray from the future in his lab, 
would it change his practice?

Mina just transcribes Dr Sewards spoken diary,
full of soul she says, with her typewriter,
and makes it immediately common and banal. (Serres)

Herzog says foreshadowed the communication age, 
integrates state-of-the art technology, 
true in terms the entries are solitary, 
readers can't make a connection.



The theory of communication treats the sign as mere message
floating above the coherent fleshly material.
from pheremonlogy to phonology.

Lyotard (42-43)
Signs substitute, to navigate in the void of unknown matter, or space, 
into the hard coded signs of language.
and Meaning is generated because there is difference from other signs.

traditional:
Message replaces information, 
sign replaces what it signifies
sign simultaneously announces and conceals (women on screen),
now nothing to conceal.

the emptiness between difference, 
relation needs to be established.
contact with alien thru language.

The articulation of the flesh, 
the limitless, futile sorting into individual parts,
forget about relation,
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable
moods, flavours and odours, all unmeasurable qualities 
that are not the same for everyone.

the coded sign, no more metaphor, or individual interpretation
subject has both encryption keys, public and private.
now only public key left,
smothered by a public identity or global 'us-ness', engineered by state.

The revision of rules, (relation), 
immutable blockchain,
rules that cannot decyphered.
interminable exchange machine, whiff of air.

nothing new, or original between sender and receiver,
as determined, a priori knowledge, 
and the sign is now based on signification alone,
detached from underlying flesh.

Modernity doesn't require knowledge, 
even monkeys can sort things
as long it understands the formula of success-ion, 
without the Absolute, the effective. 


Terror excites identity, by concentrating it, and packaging 
it in a false simplicity. ~Nick Land

Eating your own shit is taboo explains Monte to the toddler,
and by repeating and distorting the hallowed word, he sanctifies it,
until it loses its analogue meaning and becomes a billowing bubble around them.

Monte light up the pyre of language and burn with it.(13, Artaud)
but still does not go mad. 



Ordinary man has a desire for understanding,
in parrot-fashion repeats
living creatures however, a thirst for knowledge.


Any experience of the I is solely made possible through the framework language,
a fact, (Reza, 296), magic powers. 

the somber spiritual physiognomy
developed free from the body?

At the edge of human thought borders the outside, 
life itself hollowed out by substitutional language.


Freud wrote <i>Totem und Tabu</i> in soulless times and
diagnoses everyone who does not tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<small>[]</small>

Language structures thought, 
but he writes madness originates in thought and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
the latter has been totally disturbed by the former, the same.

Artificial Intelligence of the mind 
is the ability to perform pointless and unnatural acts, (roadside picnic)
careful to not make mistakes like thoughtless nature, 
but earthly biological life was only possible, by what is today considered as
pathological, 
man lose this ability, thus goes extinct.  



The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
In his defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.


His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 


modernity and neurosis has defeated Germany
which just as Europe has no common culture
tribes patched together, territory in central Europe, 

connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without Freud German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.

The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most savage, as they shockingly even don't know political leaders, 
is built around the prevention of incestial behaviour, or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) and 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben, 
a template of pattern, on which we practice further knowledge
not just copy the prescribed, or decorate with ornaments 
but radical new forms, by remaining sceptic, aware and suspicious.

Jung, found out that 
phantasy constructs, of the devalued children of the earth, e.g. 
Geisteskranke (dementia preacox) , conicide with the cosmogenics of primitives.

<p>To break through language in order to touch life is to create or recreate the theater; ~Antonin Artaud</p>

not transcendence but immanence
Werner Herzog, integrates the plague in his adaptation 
Nosferatu.

The plague as purification/putrification


Artaud speaks of the Black Death as  psychic entity, a pseudoplague,
as its sudden occurence coincide with grave socio-political change,
that now protractive and global, like war.

When confronted with mortality, the extinction of a whole species, 
clarity of certain death, ousted by their belief system
utter madness,  
previous stable social structures dissolve into smelly streams of rotten flesh (bwo?)
the doomed are under free will to "die Sau rauslassen",  
and perform necrophil acts without any beneficial use 
and the theater is born.(24)

if such mighty scource is needed to bring out free will
then it shows the distorted relation, of mind, body, soul

Inversion of actors and roles, witnessed in contemporary politics

auto-imun desease, eats their own children
T
the theater, 
scourge 
materilzation of intelligent force into an army of (b)rats, 
to bring upon death, so humans can steals away from responsiblilty.  
the contagion, placeholder, scapegoat for the unexplicable. 


The body rebels (19) performs exorcism to (20) discharge its internal rottenness, 
Freudian slips,
(21)
plague affects brains and lungs, 
function, we can consciously manipulate through the mind. 


(23) rather spectacle? panic in towns ,no toilet paper
explosion of deaths. 

(24) victim who dies without material destruction, stigma of abstract disease upoin him 
similar to an actor, 
penetrated by his role. 
(reaction although nothing has happened, coz simulation and the body is still the same)
has visions. 

(25) the plague means change, opportunity to play another role. 
physical disorganization
parasite, noise


however, less energy needed for an actor than true murderer?
murderes fury exhausts itlef, (open systmen)
actor in circle, (fury negates itself, frees itself, normal)
the lunatic in the asylum .
(26)without killing, provokes most mysterious alterations not only individual
but entire populace. 
blindness -corruption of the soul 
(27) the plague is communicative, the mind believes what it sees  and acts accordingly.





evolution can not go backwards, as there never been
only metamorphosis.

so called weak force, dark force, is stronger than you think.
