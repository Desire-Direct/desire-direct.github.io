Descartes, six primitive passions like esteem and scorn
Land duty to philosophy


The animal consortium
national property, facism, glands
but is ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.

The blind toddler is in relation with 
Hume's problem of induction,
is it how to get clues without experience, general claims to predict the future, 
are overruled by the element of surprise, 
which is rationalized by hindsight, 
as it already there a script somewhere on the computer, 
the subconscious knew it all along
tty (teletype), number of terminal window


which would be 
demonstrative argument=
but as too many factors dismissed, wrong kind of conclusion ?? 

probable=circular cos no experience?, no proof
speculative


His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 


modernity and neurosis has defeated Germany
which just as Europe has no common culture
tribes patched together, territory in central Europe, 




scapegoat dissidents, who fight holey war
instead of dignity on slaughter victims, 
focus is put on "exitement"
blame tech, is only distraction globalised capitalism
tainted with condescension


Body consists of endless individual components, 
that through recongizable soft- and wetness, 
continously move and deform, through external shear stress

Defamed raticus Descartes, how he is fondly nicknamed,  
now only infamous in undergrad circles, misunderstand the mind-body union, 
but there's so much more to it,
and the trite but surely true "I think, therefore I am" quote,
can only properly interpreted by the scholars of philsophy.

Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, aware of the weakness of her sex, 
judiciousness
cure in philosophy,

how to access the technology of the emotions?
whether the mind can control the body?
by reflecting the mind, meditation, work


the soul, thinking substance, function is what it does, 
converses with the material brain? to produce thought
immaterial to put the body in motion?

Soul in unison with body, still distinct. is it a matrix that envelopes the body,
that can act and be acted upon. surface tension

algorithms of the mind, that can not be captured by the mind?

A sharp mind must consider the body as impersonal,
inhuman does not understand human sewage 
of plastic identity based on gender, nationality or consumer goods, 
which floats on the ocean.
identity, foremost private, 
Unviversal, or global 'us-ness' is engineered by state

Human does not understand the adrenal gland either
Body and mind are seperate entities, which have to live nearby, 
what can be done  to establish contact, 
as they speak language, alien


Being rational means to access the realm of emotions by reason alone?
not possible pure reason?


Lem predicted AGI in Solaris, an unbound ocean, which displays endless phenomena 



and sinners confronted with their sins. 
and portrays human xenophobia towards the ocean, 
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, in order to get sane response.  


Lem: dream expample, 
in dreams the subconsious makes up surprises,
we don't know, what happens.

Lem (75), humans don't want to conquer the cosmos, 
in everything we are seeking man, to have a mirror.

Terror excites identity, by concentrating it, and packaging it in a false simplicity. ~Nick Land



analytic mechanics, about laws on the motion of bodies
galilei?? didn't use balance, what then?  
acceleration, kinematic

binary stars orbiting each other, together the make
the brightest star in the night sky
Sirius, colloquially known as the Dog Star 
suffering smoldering life
thanatos
A is about twice as massive as the sun
B receeded to white darf, 

The recalcitrance of the hysterical absolute, 
resigns from completely dissolving into 'reality', 
but like the fluid jets of a black hole, extensions, 
thought, 


hidden, private code

Eating your own shit is taboo, explains Monte to the toddler,
and by repeating and distorting the hallowed word, he sanctifies it,
until it loses its analogue meaning and becomes a billowing bubble around them.
Freud wrote <i>Totem und Tabu</i> in a soulless past and
diagnoses everyone who doesn't tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, 
absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).


Neurosis is affect thinking, which does not vibe in accordance with reality 
and his passionate writing on primitives only proves his point

he writes
madness originates in thought and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
but what if the latter has been totally disturbed by the former?
earthly biological life was only possible, by what is today considered as
pathological, a thoughtless, de-creative cooperation between neurons.

reengineering of thought by the Messieurs of modern science, 
which resulted in AGI, mass

as many German scientists at the turn of the 20th century
from the Boltzmann delirium, which stems from the fallacy, that thought comes  from nowhere?
true modern science has no ground
God exists, Plato goodness, encourage to seek knowledge and not statistics. 


connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.

The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most savage, as they shockingly even don't know political leaders, 
is built around the prevention of incestial behaviour, or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) and 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben, 
a template of pattern, on which we practice further knowledge
not just copy the prescribed, or decorate with ornaments 
but radical new forms, by remaining sceptic, aware and suspicious.

Jung, who has found out that 
phantasy constructs of the devalued children of the earth, i.e.  
Geisteskrank (dementia preacox), conicide with the cosmogenics of savages. 



The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
In his defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.

Contrary to popular belief, 
the <i>Big Bang</i> factually made it possible 
increasingly 
that light got scarce and the expanding universe holey.
Objects of massive gravity 

once sucked into there is no escape of 
internaising its imperial ideology of abstraction.




I love exploring the Outside without the aid of high tech and leave the mobile phone at home.bla
one which hasn't internet at all and the other under constant development.
Anyway questing it's better focusing on the movements environment, and relearn to trusting the senses, 
which I often felt deceived upon.


The enourmous silence, only to be interrupted by the great spotted woodpecker 
I feel safe in the former local Forest Sauvage  
and enjoy actually getting lost, knowing find the way back eventually in time.

A deliberate, conscious, constant de /reterritorialization
space becomes territory when it's incorporated in the mind, as they say

That's how I conquer foreign territory, the state border 
the quest, which led me to France in the summer of 2023.

it is good to discover big cities like parithes, in the manner of a flaneuse, 
to find extraordinary people and places, which aren't mapped and def not recommended in any tourist guide.

In Normandy, I got pretty lost once and sore feet, 
wandering endlessly in circles, while following misleading signs which didn't anything signify,
when walking from my base camp in st.aubin, where I've pitched my pavillion,  
to find the Radar facility in Douvres.
Signals to indicate that I was not welcome, me in the gestalt of Miss Bryant, fair hair 
mistaken me for a German spy, handed me the German brochure, which was useless
fell again to the promise of a young and handsome Canadian tour guide. 


But indeed I was sniffing the Radar station, no interest in their nazi memorabilia
the mirror deflection, from the sky




Anyway further interest in magnetism and gravity, knowledge which I will need for later projects.
puzzled by the waves inside of earth, which remains a conundrum, as outer space.


I got a (military) prismatic compass for a reasonable price, to practice navigation
and got a hiking map of 1:25000, as recommended in the video,
of 

that military compass, not for civilian use?
can be used as theodolite


What is magnetic declination? 


dEVIATION in degrees from direction shown on the map 
geographical north pole 
magnetic north pole

As above so below.european
Lodestone "course stone"
magnetite, is attracted my magnets but 
still puzzle, how lodestones become magnets themselves
by lighnting bolts.


durch den günstigen Verlauf der magnetischen Feldlinien in Bayern 
muss diese Abweichung zwishcen magnetischen un geographischer nordrichtung
bei praktischer Anwendung von topografischen Karten nicht berücksichtigt werden
