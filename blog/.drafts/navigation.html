lit Cybergothic is celebrating otherness,
subculture of the enlightenment 
and throws its shadows 
on Cathedral ruin, 

the Un-life was haunted by insomnia
having intercourse with monsters in the bowels of the Crypt.

laden with venom, that makes you change
and die by neuroelectronic death hurt.
older than natural mortality?

who carry invisible but perceptible noise-data
grounded in foul earth truth, and the only cure to eat it. 


The incapability to produce precise images,
symbolically defined by romantic goths like Caspar David Friedrich, 
impressed by light, where arise as stark dark matter,
and expressing the awe of a steady if unspectacular
monstrous force nature.

vagualy realistic naivitee, brought to life by loose and visible brushwork

death, ice and snow

displaying fellow humans from behind as contemplating objects
in their fortress of solitude

staring into the terrors of the hyperdimensional sublime 
like in a mirror, 
depends on perspective 
megalophobia  

the shudder at sudden appearance
and carries out the threat
ships signal hope, but mere ghosts from the pasts

pushes silent background noise into the foreground


A renaissance of nature, Friedrich retreats


and turns his back at industrialization
from a distance he observes fellow tiny humans, 
touching their soul.

fear of smth big, 


and portraits of what can not be painted, the soul
(in the eyes?)

in stark contrast, colors
grown as it is (realism), beauty bizarre
expressionism




<i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), 
IMHO a faithful parasitic representation of the novel,
shows a portrait of a younger Count,
which resembles the famous work of Albrecht Dürer

who mastered the classical art of painting
at the turn of the millenium

the renaissance, rebirth of the classical age,  
egotism

metal movable type

no one asks in the middle age where we shall begin


previous shys away from the confrontion with his 
hypnotic eyes,  
which give reflection of light, alive (woke)
facing the reality 
on the climax of youth, maturity now courage for real self
in a ()hole, like schizo Descartes on century later?

blending out world around him
(Batty, subject never dies, mind can't cope mortality)
sensual bouche, framed by striking hair and fur, hand

mock his heresy, egocentrism? 
My opinion as a creative practicioner, 
resembling could be not intentional, accidental. 
 he's genuius, the fantastic I is all we possess.


and he merged most possible self in one image, 
the dead ones, future ones?
or the experience, improved painting?


immortal ghost of his former self, 

mortals can see themselves, in all their balance of power and weakness, 
if disturbed, narcissism or lack of confidence,                                                                     

The Wampyr eats you from the inside, 
once a fatty from nourishing blood, 
the thin white Count is now only a shadow of himself

bad, bloodless, weak bitches,



eats you alive, and keeps you un-live.


can not be seen in mirror (in herzog smashes it)
self-hatred?
organism of constant? inversion?
making himself a revolutionary within the struggle itself

The master of bats, rats and  wolves envelops the void under his cape, 
but is prisoner by the very same
opens it, to gives off a whiff of contaminated air,
miasma, to do their deed

What can we learn from Shariati, who sees the gravest tragedy in modernity
in the destruction of collective will
sculpting from within.

self-sculpting, inhuman form not transcendence

huge gap of uneducted-eductated,
(unknowledge brought on by capitalism and AI)
and failed revolutions?

previously bonded through a shared ideology, replaced by capital.
not existant in godless society, 

what is an enlightened soul? "self-conscious about society"

Where shall we begin/done? books like this all over the place,
but societal transformation lies in god's hand, 
and is rather "social strategy" (politics, lead to wrong actions) not ideology (religion/scientific theory)

Shariati speaks of "enlightened souls", 
and a good example is the the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing, 
best fiend of Count Dracula, (not enlightened? thus irresponsible) 
who just like him neither keeps a diary, nor writes lenghtly letters.
not into politics, bereichern?
As pitch light and bright dark can be, hang about 
 at the opposites borders of the unaware grey mass.
Van Helsing takes on responsibility to build a bridge,

prophet merging with the mass, (unlike revolutionary count?)

by help a static, frozen society to change direction, wherever that might be. 
social direction, cuddle up in the middle
not false prophets inflame their hearts giving direction. 
(white /dark, but stay in the twilight?)
revolutionary leaders not belong to educated class, warrior like Dracula, 
speak to emotions, drag em on the dark side.

No one questions his integrity, 
acts freely with his "pseudo-scientific" knowledge, which homes also the  occult,
smth which lingers beyond empirical.

even when he demands to cut Lucy's head off and fill her mouth with garlic,
after the evil spirits left her corpse, rational, she's dead.
also very polite actor, inflame their hearts with kind- and gentleness, a new faith
(in themselves?)
is he Naturphilosoph, combines scientific practice with mental work, 


He is leading on a group of people, unable to form a logic of events on their own,
who are in doubt of what they've seen, can't make connection to the supernatural,
a mind-openener to empirical knowledge, building a bridge to the heart.
breaking their belief system, 
slowly!! teach them critical thinking by giving clues.
self-confidence /awareness

repeated observation must be so, 
bite marks at the neck,  vampyre incident
conscious what goes on, 
is felt, but not perceived. (soulless society)


The elimination of the proletariat in the West, 
who had lots of generla knowledge
by the formation of a lower well-off, middle class,
who have given peanuts to shut up, 
but with label of bourgoise feel entitled complain
  and rightly so, poorest, soulless  consumer-pigs ,

developed legions of work robots, 
with limited access to universal education, 
but mass media.
blame the wrong type of technology. 

also captives of modern tradition (but only bad habit)

kill the middle man (educated middle class?, intelligencia)

without support of the 
knowledgable,soulful former working class, 
in union with educated class and leftover working class, 
ever more so burdened, 
of overwhelming amount of intellecutal and social labour to do.
paying each other respect. 


is the poor, who are granted no voice. (south gaza)
working class
no respect but portrayed as a vermin, at best a dumb joke, 
so that the paying new bourgeousie, feels better  and intellectual. 


the filthy rich, unbelievable so far off, unreachable to kill. 
can do what they like, ants to them.  

(stopped at page4)

Renfield is the prototype of a modern brainsick
and slavishly adores master Dracula,
for he holds the supernatural power 

to make women 
The airy phantasms insatiable nymphomaniacs for other men, 
substitute for concrete women, unloved tragic figures, can't find love, hate them?
from outside brute wretch, inside weak?
who would only divert men from the death drive.


in which they are not particular interested but in general.
das ganze


rather drawn to the destructive force of sadism, to which he successfully falls victim, 
by getting his body brutally smashed.
death drive  literally power over sex, control life
which re-objectifies Un-life into death weapons,

Man fears the weird phenomenon of attraction,
and the only the cure for the mental illness romantic love is death,
but not as much as the deeply desired but feared encounter with the opposite sex.
(xxi) 

renfield kills life,
careless, not bother about his life or others


Werner Herzog cunningly disses Stoker for his mediocre writing, 
which only mirrors his own authentic, childlike style and dark humour. 

Helsing: child-brain Dracula? 
because his I is repeatedly dying, but body not
like a child, he can't go from a particulari ad universale (362)
different empirical experiences. 
to do more (criminal once it works, do it again?, or try again until
he learnt his trade)

treats the other with scorn and scapegoat women, jews, or rats.




Do all 'evil' emotions originate in sex? 


like esteem and scorn (descartes)
yes, ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.

instead of dignity of their slaughter victims, 
make the enemy  smaller, vermin
tainted with condescension

Inversion of actors and roles, witnessed in contemporary politics


<p>
Herzog  shows empathy for the soulless Count, 
as the absence of love is the most abject pain, 
and gives Nosferatu a soul in shape of Klaus Kinski.

Stoker is a gay schizo goth, trying different gender roles.
who sketches the protoganists 
caricatures after the ideal of Romanticism, which tries to fix nature, 
as dumb, helpless and pretty.
Mina heroine


as in romanticism, 
who only in pretense, 
back to true values, reevalution of nature
not materialistic but spiritual?


The epistolary novel <i>Dracula</i> gives reality to the events,


Theweleit sees the skin-deep renovation project "Beauty", 
together with de and resexualisation of the Mensch.
in opposition with experience of the own body.

idea of body is anyway distorted
through bodies emotional manipulation, Affektion
 on Geist.
(Spinoza, 50),
lehrsatz 13, body is object (not subject!!!) of the idea (or geist)

body = abstract object

The way of objectification/representational character, 
taking in sexuality, is the only way to go.


from need to desire of sex?
the image of the unreachable woman is sexualised
(wanking no touch)
abstract object of desire?
display of outer beauty, tinder apps
function of sex dissolved in cyberspace of information


cybersex, prosthetic extension

a desexualization, autoeroticism verboten, 
the most likely way a woman can cum.  
involving the brutal resexualization, 


(423) Theweleit asks what kind of reality does 
the enforcement of involuntary monogamy, 
skin-deep relations produce,
alienation between man and woman,(421)
but also their own feelings and bodies, 

"prescribed closeness" with "the one", 
exactly, a growing hatred of women in general.


Of the oppressed rights to generally heighten them in public, 
but privately fuck em in the toilet in private.

such as English rose *unfuckable* Lucy, 
who wants to love all her admirers,
blood transfusion on her deathbed,
in absence of her cuckold groom Arthur. 

[in this chapter drawing heavily on Sittengeschicht by Fuchs.]


The nouveau riche intruding the royal courts, 
is a pain in the arse for the poor nobility,
to differentiate from working class, only by means of capital and 
follow the examples of debauchery of aristrocracy.
the lady not full envy, makes middle class even more furious. 
with their BFF, sweet-tempered Mina and Lucy exchange of letters
in a pleasant language, showering each other with compliments but
zombie brains, but their romantic affairs.

No change?
In the simulation,
With cybersex in the libidinal economy, 
men and women must only provide to platforms, 
desire inseparable with Capital. 
women present their fertile eggs, and men 
spray semen over the www.
efficient, cowardly way , no time for dating,
intellecuteal peasants, where women are nothing but cattle, lifestock 
animal husbandry as lucrative business model. 
in the game of power.

evolution can not go backwards, as there never been
only metamorphosis.

Human mimicks the animal, language prey,
more attractive with masquerade for the opposite gay sex, 

to exaggerate their sexual characteristics,
but pressured into of what the market, not the better half wanted, 
fashion industr, 
gross perfume over pleasant smell of ballsacks and cunts,
powdering the pale skin, tanning
the 70s , then the removal of body hair.  
as chemistry can not be trusted.
now norm clothing, or naked, simple like bacteria. 


Women are pigeonholed to be gifted by soft skills, 
to make perfect socialites, 
and are sentenced to toxic work at vanity fair
the benefactor, however, 
freed from easy social work,
hard science of power games in solitude. 
(426) "der Gönner und humeur"

Harker and Mina, both trained in stenography, although since 1885, described only women.
working class Mina, proud of that skill trained stenotypist 
becomes male
(a convergance of a profession, machine, and sex speaks the truth, kittler 183)



Raw, violent biological sex has been softened by cultural code,
to become a romanticized business deal, to provide safety.
choosing beauty over freedom.

quwerty, decision final

-------------------------------------------------------------

Luciana:

but this has only to do with male model of pleasure,
coz of binary 1 and 0, of collision and repulsion.


binarism of sex
it always want what you can't have,
to fill lack with penis, 
which is already in abundance void vagina.


Luciana propose a third way (4), between (dis)embodiement
a wild "information trading" across sex, animals and machines,(bacterial?)
without coming. (the vampyre, who cant petite mort)
or the collective power of conatus?(32)
only collsion that makes mutation
repulsion not poss, coz anyway connected somehow
merging into a new body while destroying another, Zellteilung???



Aufklärung is the impossible act of deterriolization,
mind reteritorialized to virtual reality.(in-between?)



autoeroticism is better, 
a good mindfuck, 

no dealing with the Other, there are no limits to the imagination, 
hard work, nothing holds us back,
no risks of heartbreak??
absence of corporeal presence reinforces male pleasure(2, Luciana)
economy of pleasure
The desire towards discharge, the drive for extinction.


no male/female transit needed, (communication) 
violence 

romantic sex is a revolt against god (christian).
magnetism, that pushes and holds bodies together, 
the relation is glued together by a child?

focus is put on "exitement"?(nietzsche?)
abstract sex has infected the body. (Dracula?)


Ceasing corporeal difference, 
everyone trans,let it all hang out, gender swap, s/m
In this experimental playground, erase past and future image of the human.
the inhuman has no identity at all, other than changing one.

Bodies become undistinguishable, conform to what sells best,
and exaggerated gender features, 
the role, sex doll, meat puppets without brains.

Women hoes do exist, just like man, 
without maternal instinct,
not by desire but unconsious drive, that their 
destiny is not to be imprisoned by children.
female identity, biological destiny
Freeing sex from its biological function,
did not liberate women, but made them hoes.


ape is understanding things by observation, but does not know. 
parallel language developed 
a desire for understanding (cells??)

A thirst for knowledge, bacteria with better language.
bring on the plague
as intelligence is the ability to establish contact,
among different lifeforms, well versed to communicate with the alien,
unanswered, unimportant bat.


It converses fluently with the materiality of the brain to produce thought,
a function, that can not be captured by the mind.


is rational subconscious
turned inside out
anthropomorphized
is the true inhuman hero.

The monster is possessed by true intelligence, 
and in his defence, he does not want to destroy the outside world, 
but fake construes. 

Artificial Intelligence of the mind 
is the ability to perform pointless and unnatural acts, (roadside picnic)
careful to not make mistakes like thoughtless nature, 
but earthly biological life was only possible, by what is today considered as
pathological, 
man lose this ability, thus goes extinct.  


Lucy choose Lord, marry rich however you wont be loved.(as in columbia movie)
and goes from virgin straight to hooker, 
adultery later. 
and to remain an empty vessel, to be filled with children, 
men in favour to maintain the claim to power of totally unbothered genes, 
rather sociality.
what monsters does this produce, in the name of random nature?
unnatural particpants, nuptial
Hybrids, which are sterile, (true Nature)

Dr. Dibs, is infertile like the modern prometheus, dies by her own hand,
who failed and killed her family, 
then vitro fertilization, to create a perfect family, fail -> death.
The ghouls, plundering dead people for lumps of rotting flesh, semen,
for the good of humanity.
The plague as purge/putrification (verfaulen) process?

saliva infect each other, peopling by reproduction?
instead of sexual production.

materilzation of intelligent force into an army of (b)rats, 

the indivdual dies?
blood nuptial gift, 
auto-imun desease, eats their own children


Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) places great emphasis on the of mass hysteria, 
born out of the plague.
The contagion, placeholder for the unexplicable in-between 1 and 0.

When confronted with (im)mortality, 
humans can steal away from responsiblilty, 
or, the burden of representation. coat, underneath void.

which means the extinction of a whole species, in favour of vampyre existance.

Artaud speaks of the Black Death as  psychic entity, a pseudoplague,
its sudden occurence coincide with grave socio-political change,
as  previous stable social structures dissolve 
into smelly streams of rotten flesh,

everlasting modern nightmare of a global protractive war, 
only die local.

Only the body has clarity of certain death, the mind ousted to believe,
belief system
or utter madness,  
the disease enables free will, suppressing reason (although era of reason)
which shows as "die Sau rauslassen",  
and perform necrophil acts without any beneficial use 
and the theater is born.(24)


<p>To break through language in order to touch life is to create or recreate the theater; ~Antonin Artaud</p>


The body rebels (19) performs exorcism to (20) discharge its internal rottenness, 
Freudian slips,
(21)
plague affects brains and lungs, 
function, we can consciously manipulate through the mind. 


(23) rather spectacle? panic in towns ,no toilet paper
explosion of deaths. 

(24) victim who dies without material destruction, stigma of abstract disease upoin him 
similar to an actor, 
penetrated by his role. 
(reaction although nothing has happened, coz simulation and the body is still the same)
has visions. 

(25) the plague means change, opportunity to play another role. 
physical disorganization
parasite, noise


however, less energy needed for an actor than true murderer?
murderes fury exhausts itlef, (open systmen)
actor in circle, (fury negates itself, frees itself, normal)
the lunatic in the asylum .
(26)without killing, provokes most mysterious alterations not only individual
but entire populace. 
blindness -corruption of the soul 
(27) the plague is communicative, the mind believes what it sees  and acts accordingly.


the dark force, is stronger than you think,
The mind neglected, merely reading poetry from a women's magazine.

Rumour has it that Fichte prefers a crystal clear <i>Wissenschaft</i>, 
finishing off the emotional tears in rain dissolving into muddy reality.

A stony evolution by descending
into the dark, inner womb, 
of Rübezahl liar's and unify with recalcitrance of the object.

Climbing to the top of the mountains of madness, 
in reason, gradually dissapates in  thin air
existing as the un-dead subject, 
which spins in double-bind with the Thing forever. 


to the swindle (Wissens) form of metaphysics,


subject only actions and language can be observed

Speleologists like Laruelle agree,
with scientific method working ice axe clearing inside philosophy
making a warm flow blood body without organs.

not half thought (Van Helsing 362), 
as child-brain dracula
again and again (until time to triumph, trial and error method?
(Kant, Heidegger or Foucault)
vorausschauend plan, but elements rest not)

thus being a straight line (tangent) that 
touching many circles.

(transcendental empirical real)
but full double-transcendental
xenology, the crystal ball, offering a real nebulous of SF 
and abstract formal logic
hynotized Mina? 

6, philosophy as a necessary medium of thinking, 
7, philoscophical decision is made by deduction,


making good use of romantic vampyr Nietzsche, who is dominating the object,
by excessively torturing bogged down philosophy 
and thus hurting himself.
The toxic hate-love relationship with philosophy 
only 'theatriclly' leaves forgoing philosophy, but advocating it.
(p 5) 


As man of the better part of the hour, Ian Hamilton Grant 
advocates the Naturphilosophen, 



who inducted? scientific knowledge into  philosophical speculative systems.

The old school producing knowledge, also from within?
new skool, hates the abyss of Absolute, 
does not understand it, wants a full picture 
nuke it, lightning flash, a mere glimpse of history
new world,
which pulls science further from clarity to obscurity.



Lem's planet Solaris displays endless phenomena, 
"the void of the Absolute"[Grant]

portrays human xenophobia towards the brutal honest ocean,
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, 
in order to get sane response.  (failed communication)
and cut short illuminates new features, 
changes the whole thing, but only to the eyes. 

potent ocean, to grow with the potentialities of the ocean
instead of bombing it, man-made evolution.
the bomb is real


Grant:
The Absolute is metamorphosis, 
actual change cannot be observed, when in it. 
only alteration.

Y2K true. 

double-mirror inside brain.

Dracula abhors the mirror, 
no reflection, coz hes change. 

Dorian Gray  
spirit face imperceptible alters 
surface does not change.
only alteration is development, real
behind 
the outside clasping movement of capital, turning against it


although he embodies change, he does not alter,



Grant asks, 
The grey zone, twilight, fog 
conqer with black, or illume from within? yup

Dracula dies exposed in the light, 
pumping light into him not. 

What if Dr. Frankenstein finds a Xray from the future in his lab, 
would it change his practice?

</p>

Dracula is both suicidal (ego) and not-suicidal (body).

He is not suicidal as he does not subscribe 
to the deadly force of capitalism, which will all mortals eradicate from earth.
Rather sleeping in his coffin all day to avoid cancerous rays of the sun, 
and leaves all the proper jobs, which is the mere replication of <i>nature</i>.



according to the science of parasitology, he is a predator, 
a server to society, too large and self-sufficient to live on a host, 


[real production, rare, improbable, immediately parasited Serres]
busy with the production of Un-life 
he un-dead come to be alive by the  exchange of body fluids, 




overflowing with information, (excessive)
leaves the scraps to the parasites.
On night shift

but to keep it real, he reterritorializes earth to the West.


<p>



blame tech, is only distraction globalised capitalism


Under the approach for the greater good,
subjective goals, desire. 
ability to speak, regulation so language is autopoesis?




<p>
Stoker's Dracula are written accounts of folk tales 
an adapted version for the perverted modern society.

Herzog says foreshadowed the communication age, integrates state-of-the art technology, 
the entries are solitary (cybernetic), 
but actions condition each other (mutation?).
Mina transcribes Dr Sewards spoken diary,
full of soul she says, and makes it immediately common and banal. (Serres)
The theory of communication treats the sign as mere message
floating above the coherent fleshly material.
from pheremonlogy to phonology.

Lyotard (42-43)
Signs substitute, to navigate in the void of unknown matter, or space, 
into the hard coded signs of language.
and Meaning is generated because there is difference from other signs.

traditional:
Message replaces information, 
sign replaces what it signifies
sign simultaneously announces and conceals (women on screen),
now nothing to conceal.

the emptiness between difference, 
relation needs to be established.
contact with alien thru language.

The articulation of the flesh, 
the limitless, futile sorting into individual parts,
forget about relation,
which is filled with uncomparable, uncountable
moods, flavours and odours, all unmeasurable qualities 
that are not the same for everyone.

the coded sign, no more metaphor, or individual interpretation
subject has both encryption keys, public and private.
now only public key left,
smothered by a public identity or global 'us-ness', engineered by state.

The revision of rules, (relation), 
immutable blockchain,
rules that cannot decyphered.
interminable exchange machine, whiff of air.

nothing new, or original between sender and receiver,
as determined, a priori knowledge, 
and the sign is now based on signification alone,
detached from underlying flesh.

Modernity doesn't require knowledge, 
even monkeys can sort things
as long it understands the formula of success-ion, 
without the Absolute, the effective.

dracula's eyes never see the light, 
Only in sleep, the soul gets perceivably 
in contact with the sedated mind

subconscious

strangely, narrative, relatively coherent, 
the duo makes films for the mind and soul, with surprising plot twists.

a unified system of darkness and light, 
in twilight zone where magic happens
forming grey knowledge, without understanding.

Soul, feel a different interpretation
of certain things
daylight experiences that are overlooked
or suppressed by overwhelming, simultaneous spontanity of external impulses?? 
in sequence?
by the mind, 
because maybe became habit or mind disturbed by random shock




the 'woke' mind is also supressed, dream/team work sedates, 

thought=world we want to be
dream= world it will might be 


Sierra: connects arbitrary causes to arbitrary effects.
thinking outside the machine.

dream patterns are puzzles, offering no solution.
the subconsious makes up surprises,
a nightmare, we don't know, what happens.


"the unexpected always happens" (118)


Without purpose, improvised problem solving.
chaotic instead of ordered lingo
somatic ritual vs semantic
order in the absence of theoretical explanation

Dreamwork is weaving, the strings. (Nervenkranker)

erpressung, lured into what into you not believe in,
coz it will hurt the team, shame mechanism

it's true isn't it, keeps us asleep, one can easily identify with.
the master narrative, patched together from fragments.
dreamwork is ideology, "synthetic narrative operations"
inversion dreamwork makes the teamwork


in groups, a common goal, working towards, achieve things, 
that were previously unthinkable. 

Lem (75), humans don't want to conquer the cosmos, 
in everything we are seeking man, to have a mirror.




Soul acts and be acted upon (only by attached souls?). 

Any experience of the I is solely made possible through the framework language,
so is AGI
and claims of nonlinguistic thought, dubious 
(Reza, 296).


the somber spiritual physiognomy
developed free from the body?

</p>

<p>
Catapulted into outer space,
the future is projected? as a based life light years in the past.

Eating your own shit is taboo, explains Monte to the toddler 
and by repeating and distorting the hollowed word,
he resanctifies it,
until it loses its analogue meaning and becomes a billowing bubble around them.

(a child not learnt lingo decently, cant form own thought? 
and stays primitive, like self-harming Kaspar Hauser)


This way the headless rider is torching the world of frozen language to
defends madness from getting sucked away by irresponsible coachmen, 
who insist to repeat in parrot-fashion a structure, 
to rein horse sense. 


Renfield's cravings for vitality, 
structured experiments with flies and spiders in the lunatic asylum,
aimed to prove how the stronger eats the weaker. 

and sees no problem in taking lives, but feels guilty, 
when it dawns upon him of taking souls.



This approach is taken up by Freud, who built his <i>Totem und Tabu</i> thesis 
on the generalization of race, ethnogeny, (Rassenkunde), 
in soulless times and
diagnoses everyone who does not tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<small>[]</small>

correctly he writes madness originates in thought 
and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
the latter has been totally disturbed by the former.


The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
(smth doesn't belong in here?
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
nO defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.


The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most unpleasant and retarded, 
as they shockingly neither idolize false prophets nor
sexual morality, but survive in the most hostile environment, 
is built around the firm prevention of incestial behaviour, 
or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 


Private vs general AI
