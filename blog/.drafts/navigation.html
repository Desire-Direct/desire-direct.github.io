 There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand. ~ Count Dracula
</p>

<p>
Lizard vs Kong

The wretched figure, 
a huggable bear, from the outside a strong, masks his inner, powerful beauty, 
eager to gain knowledge about human nature, which it does not understand.

The monster is in possession of true intelligence, 
he does not want to destroy the outside world, 
in his defence, but fake construes. 


His body is a rag rug of dead matter, 
unlike bodies of soft- and wetness, continously move and deform, 
through external shear stress turns into hardware.



This makes him a wretch, remains insufficiently visceral
(because he  BwO?)
the past examined only through isolated symptoms 


The Count gives off only a whiff of foul air 
although he embodies change, he can not alter. 
nothing but abyss hides under his cape, 
the master of bats, rats and  wolves.
plague


(nymphomaniac vampyre, sadistic Dracula?)

At the edge of human thought borders the outside, 
hollowed out by substitutes, filled with meaning, fantasy.

Artaud:
(18)
pseudoplague
lightning-like appearance of plague
materilzation of intelligent force in close contact with fatality. 
army of rats
Plagues coincide with most profound political upheavals, gnon.
psychic entity rather plague contagion
(19)
organic upheavel.
bubo,Leistenbeule, favourite spot for getting the lava out. 
(20)the bubo, discharges either its internal rottenness, or even life. 
the most terrible plague is the one that does not reveal its symptoms. 
plague not destrction of body, but disorder of body fluids. 
(21)
plague affects brains and lungs, only organs we can consciously 
manipulate. Artaud, don't think its bazille alone 
that brought plague upon, 
(22) why does scource plague them, who want to flee from it, and not
those who confront it?
(23) rather spectacle? panic in towns ,no toilet paper
explosion of deaths. 
(24) the theater is born . madness
Nothing to lose but life. 
victim who dies without material destruction, stigma of abstract disease upoin him 
similar to an actor, penetrated by his role. (reaction although nothing has happened)
has visions. 
(25) the plague means change, opportunity to play another role. 
physical disorganization
however, less energy needed for an actor than true murderer?
murderes fury exhausts itlef, (open systmen)
actor in circle, (fury negates itself, frees itself, normal)
the lunatic in the asylum .
(26)without killing, provokes most mysterious alterations not only individual
but entire populace. 
blindness -corruption of the soul 
(27) the plague is communicative, the mind believes what it sees  and acts accordingly.



why does he drag the earth to another place? to keep it real?
The Count is more a threat from the inside, (time, nature, real)
auto-imun desease, eats their own children

mitigated by superstition, but only cured by death.
The un-dead come to be alive by the  exchange of body fluids, 
saliva infect, blood nourish

One can only make an image of nature, 
skillfully painted in metaphors
by goths like Caspar David Friedrich or Mary Shelley,
ugly
tries to in nature, crime, madness, 
death as substitute for emotional eruption, fix the unfixable.

The Gothic seen as a reaction to the enlightenment, 
the gothic stands for transgression, marginality, 'otherness'.  
(nick groom), a deviant from modernity, allies with the monster. 
Count Dracula can not be painted, he is change.



came by supernatural force technology, 
electricity, , which is kindly provided by nature.

Lyotard (42-43): 
The world, once full of wonder,
signs substitute for matter,
hard coded signs like language.

Meaning because there is difference from other signs

The theory of communication treats the sign 
as mere message
detached from its fleshly material, 
thrown away as a dead lump without meaning.

Space is filled up by mere relation,
no void, nor emptiness between difference, 

The articulation of the flesh, 
the limitless sorting into individual parts,
that could be filled with uncomparable, uncountable
moods, flavour or odour.
unmeasurable qualities.
the same for everyone.

individuality is foremost private, solaris, ghosts haunting.
unviversal identity or global 'us-ness' is engineered by state.

nothing to new/original to pack between sender and receiver. 
sender once god (now only learnt experience/a priori/know already)
sign now based on signification alone,
not on underlying flesh.

traditional:
Message replaces information, 
sign replaces what it signifies
sign simultaneously announces and conceals (women on screen)

now nothing to conceal

coded sign, subject has both encryption keys, public and private.
now only public key left.

The revision of rules, (relation), immutable
rules that cannot decyphered.

The sign is no more metaphor, 

interminable (unstoppable exchange) of superficial
not even skin-deep

from pheremonlogy to phonology.

tamed by structured language, and thus thought.
making it a subject to science, was part of that irrationality.
stripping away the vital part of what once defined human.  

</p>


<p>
Fichte wants a clear philosophy, a Wissenschaft, 
rather than the swindle (Wissens) form of metaphysics,
a stony evolution rather muddy metamorphosis.

ex hypothesi he says, 
actor and object has to be one, otherwise subject.
and says the character of reason 
object exists only within a person /time/ego?
the inner is dark, only actions /language can be observed.


Intelligence is the ability to establish contact
among different lifeforms, well versed to communicate with the alien,
unanswered, unimportant bat.
 
Intelligence of the mind is the ability, 
to perform pointless and unnatural acts, (roadside picnic)
careful to not make mistakes like dumb nature, 
man lose this ability, thus goes extinct.  



The soul, ephemeral air grounded in truth, 
envelopes dead matter, and puts it in motion.
It converses fluently with the materiality of the brain to produce thought,
a function, that can not be captured by the mind.

understanding mind has no actual knowledge of  the body,
is a seperate entity, which has to live nearby, 
dumb to communicate. 

Man has a desire for understanding,
living creatures however, a thirst for knowledge.

Modernity doesn't require knowledge, 
even monkeys can sort things
as long it understands the formula of success-ion, 
without the Absolute, the effective. 


Terror excites identity, by concentrating it, and packaging 
it in a false simplicity. ~Nick Land



</p>

<p>
Raw, violent sex, softened by social and cultural code,
superseded by abstract sex.

With cybersex, 
libidinal economy, 
men and women must not provide, 
present their fertile eggs, and can spray semen over the www.

self-satisfaction is always better, 
not to deal with others, phantasies, men no work. 
Not holding back, 
the desire towards discharge, drive for extinction

no male/female transit needed, 
meaning of violent passage is missing. 
romantic Sex as a revolt against god (christian).

magnetism, that pushes and holds bodies together, a child?



focus is put on "exitement"?

abstract sex has infected the body. (Dracula?)

absence of corporeal presence reinforces male pleasure(2, Luciana)
economy of pleasure

20th century, freeing sex not only from its biological function,
with cybersex, a contact of bodies not needed, 
mind simulation.

Ceasing corporeal difference, 
everyone trans,let it all hang out, gender swap, s/m
In this experimental playground, erase past and future image of the human.
inhuman

On the other hand, bodies become undistinguishable, 
conform 
and exaggerated gender features, 
the role, sex doll, meat puppets without brains.

Women hoes do exist, just like man, 
without maternal instinct.
not by desire but unconsious drive, that their 
destiny is not to be imprisoned by children.
female identity, biological destiny


why contrast strongly with Cartesian disembodiment in the cyberspace of information?
coz going back to the body actually??

Redundant parents, so important, 
growing up, egg, influenced by education. 


What if Dr. Frankenstein finds a Xray from the future in his lab, 
would it change his practice?
Miserable Dr Dibs, like the modern prometheus, killed her family, 
then vitro fertilization, 

Frankenstein, 
a trans man,  wants to create, which kills his family. 

Both ghouls, a monster, 
plundering dead people for lumps of rotting flesh
student of natural philosophy, for the good of humanity.


mind, body but he forget the soul, losing control of the wretch.
inanimate/animate

the inhuman has no identity at all. 


Frankenstein's wild wretched creature, is rational subconscious
turned inside out
anthropomorphized
is the true inhuman hero.
Fleeing in to ice, cold, no fame in the circus,
all he wants is seeking a humble life with a wretched mate,
never find acceptance by human.

desire inseparable with Capital. 

efficient, no time for dating,
getting each other to know romanticed, a ritual of modernity.
True kids by pheremones not needed not so long ago, chemistry.
marriage with idiot. 


Dracula hides in his coffin by day, 
Victor Frankenstein in his lab by night,
to create monsters with self-destructive traits, thus victims.

</p>


<p>
Dracula makes female vampyres his bitches, makes them sluts
insatiable sexual desire, for other men.
Not particularly interested?

he holds sexual power, feared by other man
gay
the look Dorian Gray not
matures
not seen in mirror
But what about his soul? 
His understanding/intellectual of the world surely heightens,
whilst his soul worsens?
ward off by superstituious ritual, the crucifix.
tutelage

Descartes, passions of the soul (emotions),
like esteem and scorn
do all evil emotions originate in sex? yes.
cybersex, prosthetic extension


There is fear but desire of sex (need??)
but is ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.

Men fear but deeply desired encounter with the opposite sex.
blame them for their weakness, sadistic, scapegoat women, jews.
instead of dignity of their slaughter victims, 
make the enemy  smaller, vermin
tainted with condescension



S and M (295, reza).



(p13, ireland, kronic)phallus one-eyed pushy perspective
males who dance


the dark figure of the thinker
therapeutic

blame tech, is only distraction globalised capitalism

Under the approach for the greater good,
subjective goals, desire. 
ability to speak, regulation so language is autopoesis?

As man of the better hour, Ian Hamilton Grant 
advocates the Naturphilosophen, 
who inducted scientific knowledge into  philosophical speculative systems.

The old school producing knowledge, from within.
new skool, hates the abyss of Absolute, 
does not understand it, wants a full picture 
nuke it, lightning flash, a mere glimpse of history
new world,
which pulls science further from clarity to obscurity.

Grant:
The Absolute is metamorphosis, 
actual change cannot be observed, when in it. 
only alteration.

Y2K true. 

double-mirror inside brain.

Dracula abhors the mirror, 
no reflection, coz hes change. 

Dorian Gray  
spirit face imperceptible alters 
surface does not change.
only alteration is development, real
behind 
the outside clasping movement of capital, turning against it

Grant asks, 
The grey zone, twilight, fog 
conqer with black, or illume from within? yup

Dracula dies exposed in the light, 
pumping light into him not. 





The blind toddler is in relation with 
Hume's problem of induction,
is it how to get clues without experience, general claims to predict the future, 
are overruled by the element of surprise, 
which is rationalized by hindsight, 
as it already there a script somewhere on the computer, 
the subconscious knew it all along
tty (teletype), number of terminal window

His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 

national property, facism, glands

modernity and neurosis has defeated Germany
which just as Europe has no common culture
tribes patched together, territory in central Europe, 
</p>


<p>
rational thought is to access the realm of emotions by reason.
Analysis, making contact.
pure reason not possible, union.
this union destroyed to make self-originating thought
control the body, by articulated cognition


Lem's planet Solaris displays endless phenomena, 
"the void of the Absolute"[Grant]

portrays human xenophobia towards the brutal honest ocean,
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, 
in order to get sane response.  (failed communication)
and cut short illuminates new features, 
changes the whole thing, but only to the eyes. 

potent ocean, to grow with the potentialities of the ocean
instead of bombing it, man-made evolution.
the bomb is real



a sur-face to spirits face?

In dreams, the body gets in contact with the conscious mind,


In dreams the subconsious makes up surprises,
nightmare, we don't know, what happens.
what produces it, teamwork, 
what/ which actors involved in weaving the dream.

Barker: freud, dreamwork keeps person asleep, which should be otherwise
woke, by all external impulses??
alternative thought-provoking stories, analyze
Freud, Interpreation of dreams of random experiences that are overlooked
by the mind. 
strangely, narrative, relatively coherent, makes films for the mind.
not soul? well, mind not dead only asleep (sleep to make contact with the soul?)
Dreamwork is weaving, the strings. (Nervenkranker)
asleep, slower mind capacity
woke, speed
mindwork, to make outside tolerable
mind interface??? model of cognition
faculty or function??????
erpressung, lured into what into you not believe in,
coz it will hurt the team, shame mechanism
true, simple slogans, like the right uses, yet betrays it by keeping
its secrets
it's true isn't it, keeps us asleep, one can easily identify with.
the master narrative, patched together from fragments.
dreamwork is ideology, "synthetic narrative operations"
inversion dreamwork makes the teamwork


in groups, a common goal, working towards, achieve things, 
that were previously unthinkable. 





Lem (75), humans don't want to conquer the cosmos, 
in everything we are seeking man, to have a mirror.

binary stars orbiting each other, together the make

xenology, mix of SF and formal logic

Soul acts and be acted upon (only by attached souls?).

"Eating your own shit is taboo", explains Monte to the toddler,
and by repeating and distorting the hallowed word, he sanctifies it,
until it loses its analogue meaning and becomes a billowing bubble around them.
Freud wrote <i>Totem und Tabu</i> in soulless times and
diagnoses everyone who does not tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).<small>[]</small>

He writes
madness originates in thought and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
but what if the latter has been totally disturbed by the former?
earthly biological life was only possible, by what is today considered as
pathological, a thoughtless, de-creative cooperation between neurons.

reengineering of thought by the Messieurs of modern science, 
which resulted in AGI, mass

as many German scientists at the turn of the 20th century
from the Boltzmann delirium, which stems from the fallacy, that thought comes  from nowhere?
true modern science has no ground
God exists, Plato goodness, encourage to seek knowledge and not statistics. 

twins murder in primitive cultures

connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without Freud German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.

The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most savage, as they shockingly even don't know political leaders, 
is built around the prevention of incestial behaviour, or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) and 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben, 
a template of pattern, on which we practice further knowledge
not just copy the prescribed, or decorate with ornaments 
but radical new forms, by remaining sceptic, aware and suspicious.

Jung, who has found out that 
phantasy constructs of the devalued children of the earth, i.e.  
Geisteskrank (dementia preacox), conicide with the cosmogenics of savages. 



The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
In his defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.


evolution can not go backwards, as there never been
only metamorphosis.

so called weak force, dark force, is stronger than you think.
</p>

<p>Notes</p>
[] Neurosis is affect thinking, which does not vibe in accordance with reality 
and his passionate writing on primitives only proves his point
