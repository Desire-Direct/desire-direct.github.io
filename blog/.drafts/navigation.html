 There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand. ~ Count Dracula

At the edge of human thought borders the outside, 
crossing it would imply death,
hollowed out substitutes, 
Dracula

We can only make an image of nature, 
romanticism beautify it, more
accurately expressed by goths like Caspar David Friedrich,
Mary Shelleys beautiful writing, 
which depicts nature and The revision of rules, 
rules that cannot decyphered.

The Gothic seen as a reaction to the enlightenment, 
the gothic stands for transgression, marginality, 'otherness'.  
(nick groom), a deviant from modernity, allies with the monster. 


Lyotard (42): WHAT we see, always treated as a sign,
but unfortunately 
sign within the theory of communication 
and thus becomes message. 
sender, once god.
two lines of thought for substitute:
message replaces information, sign replaces what it signifies
sign simultaneously announces and conceals (women on screen)




ex hypothesi

replaces something for someone.
hollowed out, only surface.


coded sign, subject has both encryption keys, public and private


Fichte wants a real philosophy, a Wissenschaft, 
rather than a (Wissens) form like metaphysics.
clear evolution rather dark metamorphosis.

Rightly he says, 
actor and object has to be one, otherwise subject.


and says the character of reason (soul? which can't accessed directly), 
object exists only within a person /time/ego?
the inner is dark, only actions /language can be observed





Intelligence is instinct, tamed by language.
making it a subject to science, resulted
stripping away the vital part of what makes us human.  
from pheremonlogy to phonology.

The revisions of Raw sex, 
by the social and cultural codes that makes sex, 
abstract sex.

20th century, freeing sex from its biological function,
with cybersex, a contact of bodies not needed, 
simulation of sex as only the mind.

without corporeal difference, 
everyone trans,let it all hang out, gender swap, s/m
In this experimental playground, erase past and future image of the human.
inhuman

Women can be hoes, just like man, without maternal instinct.
Destiny to be imprisoned by children, 
not by desire but unconsious drive.

with abstract sex, men must not provide 
and can spray semen over the www.

self-satisfaction,
better, not to deal with others, phantasies, men no work. 

the production of kids under economic regime, 2 kids per household
designed frankentsteins?
which accomodates the parents lifestyle.

Not holding back, 
the desire towards discharge, drive for extinction

absence of corporeal presence reinforces male pleasure(2, Luciana)
economy of pleasure

female identity, biological destiny

no male/female transit needed, violent passage is missing. 


Redundant parents, so important, 
growing up, egg, influenced by education. 


Dr Dibs, like the modern prometheus, killed her family, 
in vitro fertilization, 

Miserable Frankenstein, a trans man,  wants to create.

a monster, rag rug of dead matter, 


mind, body but he forget the soul, losing control of the wretch.

inanimate/animate



the inhuman wants no Identity at all. 
Frankenstein's wretched creature 
anthropomorphized
is the true inhuman hero.
Fleeing in to ice, cold.
seeking a humble life with a mate,
acceptance of being a wretch.

The creature doesn't want fame.
The problem with desire is, that it became inseparable with Capital. 



efficient, no time for dating,
getting each other to know romanticed, a ritual of modernity.


True kids by pheremones not needed not so long ago, chemistry.
marriage with idiot. 



why contrast strongly with Cartesian disembodiment in the cyberspace of information?
coz going back to the body actually??

fleshly ties
with culture > natural sex
frees from reproduction but 



abstract sex has infected the body. (Dracula?)

Dracula makes female vampyres his bitches, makes them sluts
insatiable sexual desire, other men
he holds sexual power, feared by other man
gay
the look Dorian Gray not
matures
not seen in mirror
But what about his soul? 
His understanding/intellectual of the world surely heightens,
whilst his soul worsens?
ward off by superstituious ritual, the crucifix.
tutelage

Descartes, passions of the soul (emotions),
like esteem and scorn
do all evil emotions originate in sex? yes.
cybersex, prosthetic extension


There is fear but desire of sex (need??)
but is ill-perceived of collision and repulsion.

Men fear but deeply desired encounter with the opposite sex.
blame them for their weakness, sadistic, scapegoat women, jews.
instead of dignity of their slaughter victims, 
make the enemy  smaller, vermin
tainted with condescension




Modernity masks nature, S and M (295, reza).


focus is put on "exitement"?
blame tech, is only distraction globalised capitalism

Dracula hides in his coffin by day, 
Dr. Victor Frankenstein by night,
hide in their laboratory,
to create
both monsters and victims, self-destructive traits.

In contrast to Dr. Frankensteins creation, 
from the outside a strong, wretched figure, 
masks his inner, powerful beauty, 
eager to gain knowledge about human nature, which it does not understand.

Nonetheless ugly, the Count gives off air of the supernatural. 
a ghost, enveloped in his material cape, 
many bats

a threat from the inside, a nonlethal desease, 
mitigated by superstition, but only cured by death.
The un-dead come to be alive by the  exchange of body fluids, 
saliva infect, blood nourish

not change but alter the individual.


Master Slave
Count Dracula the batkeeper, also wolves. 
embodiement of time itself
can not alter but change.



individuality is foremost private, solaris, ghosts haunting.
unviversal identity or global 'us-ness' is engineered by state.



The soul, instinct is an intelligent, immaterial  substance, 
which envelopes the body, dead matter, and puts it in motion.

It converses fluently with the materiality of the brain to produce thought,
a function, that can not be captured by the mind? 
mechanically, structured by language, 

but no actual knowledge of  the body,
mind is a seperate entity, which have to live nearby, 


Man has a desire for understanding,
living creatures however, a thirst for knowledge.

Modernity doesn't require knowledge, 
even monkeys can sort things
as long it understands the formula of success-ion, 
without the Absolute, the effective. 


True intelligence is the ability to establish contact,
among different lifeforms, or the THING.

Idealism hates Naturphilosophie, can not be understood,
but is knowledge producing, for contact with the Outside.  


to establish contact with alien language, requires intelligence
language structures thinking
metamorphosis, evolution, backwards. 

The unanswered, unimportant bat 


intelligence of the mind is the ability, 
to perform pointless and unnatural acts, 
don't want to make mistakes like nature, 
man lose this ability, thus goes extinct.  


Frankenstein's monster is nature, an animal,
in possession of true intelligence, 
not destroying the outside world.
But the fake construes. 


"teamwork does not make the dream work, it makes the corporate nightmare work."

What if Dr. Frankenstein finds a Xray from the future in his lab, 
would it change his practice?

Only ephemeral air is grounded in truth, 



Grant:
metamorphosis, actual change cannot be viewed
only alteration


which pulls science further from clarity to obscurity.


can not be.

the action, so language is autopoesis?

Under the approach for the greater good,
subjective goals, desire. 




spirit imperceptible matures
behind nach aussen gerichtet interface of capital
anti-imun desease
can not be altered but changed
only alteration is development

Out of twilight, 
Hegelian picture thinking
with a ray of sunbeam, all of a sudden
new world

Unaltered Dracula dies in the light, change everything.
does he wear a mask?




Frankenstein, graspable monster, but also made by supernatural force. 
or technology, which is kindly provided by nature.

His body consists individual components, 
soft- and wetness, continously move and deform, 
through external shear stress 
into hardware
This makes him a wretch, remains insufficiently visceral
(because he no BwO?)
the past examined only through isolated symptoms 
(nymphomaniac vampyre, sadistic Dracula?)

magnetism

Sex as a revolt against god (christian), mind/body
Kaspar David, fog
romanticism, gothic
tries to in nature, crime, madness, death as substitute for 
emotional eruption, fix the unfixable.

The blind toddler is in relation with 
Hume's problem of induction,
is it how to get clues without experience, general claims to predict the future, 
are overruled by the element of surprise, 
which is rationalized by hindsight, 
as it already there a script somewhere on the computer, 
the subconscious knew it all along
tty (teletype), number of terminal window

His
psychoanalytic reasearch wants to show that
individual and Voelkerpsychiologie must be put together, 
individual can be only form a one with the others.

Another attempt is made by LeBon, who wrote a manual for aspiring fascist leaders.
examines the psychology of Mass,  
how individuals in an organized mass 

national property, facism, glands

modernity and neurosis has defeated Germany
which just as Europe has no common culture
tribes patched together, territory in central Europe, 
</p>



Being rational means to access the realm of emotions by reason alone?
not possible pure reason?


Lem's planet Solaris displays endless phenomena, 
and confrotns sinners with their sins. 
portrays human xenophobia towards the honest ocean,
which must be bombed by xray, thermonuclear, 
in order to get sane response.  (failed communication)

In dreams the subconsious makes up surprises,
nightmare, we don't know, what happens.
what produces it, teamwork, 
what/ which actors involved in weaving the dream.

Barker: freud, dreamwork keeps person asleep, which should be otherwise
woke, by all external impulses??
alternative thought-provoking stories, analyze
Freud, Interpreation of dreams of random experiences that are overlooked
by the mind. 
strangely, narrative, relatively coherent, makes films for the mind.
not soul? well, mind not dead only asleep (sleep to make contact with the soul?)
Dreamwork is weaving, the strings. (Nervenkranker)
asleep, slower mind capacity
woke, speed
mindwork, to make outside tolerable
mind interface??? model of cognition
faculty or function??????
erpressung, lured into what into you not believe in,
coz it will hurt the team, shame mechanism
true, simple slogans, like the right uses, yet betrays it by keeping
its secrets
it's true isn't it, keeps us asleep, one can easily identify with.
the master narrative, patched together from fragments.
dreamwork is ideology, "synthetic narrative operations"
inversion dreamwork makes the teamwork


in groups, a common goal, working towards, achieve things, 
that were previously unthinkable. 





Lem (75), humans don't want to conquer the cosmos, 
in everything we are seeking man, to have a mirror.

Eating your own shit is taboo, explains Monte to the toddler,
and by repeating and distorting the hallowed word, he sanctifies it,
until it loses its analogue meaning and becomes a billowing bubble around them.
Freud wrote <i>Totem und Tabu</i> in a soulless past and
diagnoses everyone who doesn't tick in the economic tact of the machine with mental illness, absurdly enough with neurosis and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).


Soul acts and be acted upon (only by attached souls?). 

Neurosis is affect thinking, which does not vibe in accordance with reality 
and his passionate writing on primitives only proves his point

he writes
madness originates in thought and not in 'realitaet des erlebens',
but what if the latter has been totally disturbed by the former?
earthly biological life was only possible, by what is today considered as
pathological, a thoughtless, de-creative cooperation between neurons.

reengineering of thought by the Messieurs of modern science, 
which resulted in AGI, mass

as many German scientists at the turn of the 20th century
from the Boltzmann delirium, which stems from the fallacy, that thought comes  from nowhere?
true modern science has no ground
God exists, Plato goodness, encourage to seek knowledge and not statistics. 




twins murder in primitive cultures

connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without Freud German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.

The whole social organization of aboriginal tribes, who Freud 
classifies as the most savage, as they shockingly even don't know political leaders, 
is built around the prevention of incestial behaviour, or a mixing of of the same kind. 


Taboo is immanent in totem, a universial social sculpture, 
and is literally pointless, perfect for future civilizations, 
Anything outside of taboo is ordinary, public access 
only by way of extensions it becomes transcedental 

Freud hesitates, but translates the Begriff in the modern tradition, 
flat and polarized, with an arrow tendency to the forbidden.


he points out thatonto- (individuel learning) and 
Phylogenetische (inert) of Seelenleben, 
a template of pattern, on which we practice further knowledge
not just copy the prescribed, or decorate with ornaments 
but radical new forms, by remaining sceptic, aware and suspicious.

Jung, who has found out that 
phantasy constructs of the devalued children of the earth, i.e.  
Geisteskrank (dementia preacox), conicide with the cosmogenics of savages. 



The book is a prime example of psyche studies by means of analytical methods gone wrong,
so he wrongly interprets "Allmacht der Gedanken" (a phrase coined by one of his patients btw), 
and blames 
comprehensive attentiveness, reasonable suspicion and the inborn ability of prevision, 
which he dismisses into the realm of hyperstition.
The latter is a primitive mode of thought as he puts it, 
a disease, that must be radically eradicated.  
Does he actually realize, that unnecessary bullshit, which is garbaging the mind and poisoning the soul,
is emotionally infected thought?
In his defense, he is bound to the godless, biopolitical millieu of human knowledge.



so called weak force, dark force, is stronger than you think.


<p>
Contrary to popular belief, 
the <i>Big Bang</i> factually made it possible 
increasingly 
that light got scarce and the expanding universe holey.
Objects of massive gravity 

once sucked into there is no escape of 
internaising its imperial ideology of abstraction.
