A sphere filled with a sea of overlapping communal agreements on objects, 

which are subjectively re /cognized with regards to time and knowledge, 
creating vertices, angles or a richness of shades, 

the impersonal mesh transmits understanding.

The wizard Merlyn explains to the Wart, how
forms of language emerged through mimicking sounds of the environment,<small>[5]</small>
that is a reproduction of selective samples of audio data 
pulsating in all matter such as air, kindred animals or pebbles.


A radiant echoing of the catchy sonorous 
The illusion over time a shift from the tangible to intangible, 
visible inversion


From the inhuman perspective, earth comes with integrated interfaces
to establish contact with alien hardware, which is
facilitated by the social network on grounds of a shared language.(Reza, p. 1)
Light and the physiology of the eye must be blamed 
for hierarchical logic and organized communication,
however a GUI will remain beyond the artefact of understanding
as mind is mirrored with a sheer function.

Fuller flips common sense by suggesting that matter is always pure but never informational,
its interpretation has been squeezed into a normative framework 

a simulation that has been copied over and over
together with countless glitches and bugs, 
and the denial of alternative possibilities in democrazy light


With reference to desktop icons, he predicts 
that their function as metaphor, or meaning, will diminish.
is perpetually and irrevocably morphing computer
a complexity beyond common sense,
so it is wise to submit to the unconditional cute.

Experience, the apparent a-priori knowledge 
of how things work,
that is beyond human understanding, or unspeakable,
must be always de- and recontstructed like a 
child's play with toy blocks.



The ear, for Nietzsche the organ of fear, 
is linked with vital drives and enables extraordinary vision in dark times, 
which explains Mach's anomalous experience of flinching before
explosions of trial booms become audible.<small>[6]</small> 
Ardent readers with an aversion to sound and touch, are equipped with an armour of seeing 

 with the ability to move and in huge imaginative space.

The truth is experienced is a visual to accoustic acceleration, 
a crooked reversal of evolution, 
as the game's strict rules disapprove modification, 

strict rules in communication is vital for preservation, 
even more
Heaven

To be sucked into the dark matrix of normative space, a reign of pure madness,
buying bespoke, expensive but worthless illusions from Apple, Netflix or Prime 
in order to exist.


The Questing Beast is capable of bending at the threshold of 0 and 1 within itself.
always pursued to never tracked down, 
the pulse of dis /appearance sneers at the conscious mind 
by a reveling an undetectable past.

The sonorous is a premordial defense against surprise when space is not 
incorporated in the mind, 
The construct of territory,  a transparent prism diverts light seeing 
social relations differently, a more sensible navigation under pressure, of collision and repulsion.







































The mis -interpretation of the foreign earth,
glitches, subconsciously adds to the engineering of a degenerate world, 
an object of massive gravity and no escape, 
once sucked into internalising its ideology of abstraction.

the wheel of accoustic to visual space turns, structured sane to the unstructered in-sane
which in light of being glued to screens sounds controversial. 



A targeted bombing of the cerebrum, which spares so-called civilians, 
the intelligence explosion
enabled humans speciality, language

-----------------------------------------
Fuller writes about the impossiblity of interface, 
but tries to define it as indivisible from, but masks the true function, of alien systems.
and due to that fact


it may change from state to state, but in principle cannot alter (p.99)
as the Real itself is eternal.

A map of cute symbols, which hide a complexity of funcitons beyond human cognition,
but 
know a-priori what will happen when a certain button is clicked. 
by reference to a understanding a pre-existing simulation of a function.
but now no understanding anymore!!

Interfaces are not black mirrors, with projections of "truth"
perpetual interpenetration of information patterns (p.99) by animal de(vice). 
but boundaries without escape, an event horizon with the impossibility of control, 


There is no software, only matter
which could be pure and never informational. (p.100)
but as soon as recognized, matter changes with imagination.
and vice versa. 


why, ceasura between matter and information? coz, information takes over
stalemate
 
simulation no longer simulate,

Fuller predicted that metaphors will dimish. (p. 100), 
coz internalising the machine
tweets of birds, now X  
doesn't understand human abstraction, and humans follow in same direction


A transmission is never pure, informational,
thus relations means always noise, and noise is not desired by logic. 
Objects in the void without social relation, isolated objects
sensory deprivation cut from external stimuli means death.


</p>

The distortion of the Real is holding hands with the pipe dream of sequential time in heaven, 
body is a hellish quantum machine of plumbless depths,
and too advanced for mechanical stagnant thought
The desire of the I is the that we see things while others remain hidden.

<p>
Naked and exposed to light, the forcefully begotten heir of the throne, takes a deep breath 
at the pressure point of simultaneously being embraced by life and death.
In the modern West, humans, like many animals, are believed to be born blind ,<small>[]</small> 
if perception is only perception when it is understanding, 
but who determines the  margins of <i>cognition</i> or normative space?

The ongoing debate of the animal consortium what makes humans prone to warfare, 
is explained by many factors national property, fascism, glands
but generally speaking it is simply the recognition of collision and repulsion, which makes warfare possible, thus 
the question if the fog of war or battleground,  futile.

The fog of war kills the process of resistant vision and engineers a new one,  
to see in visual space but shuts to the see the waves. 
(101)

The focus on individualism, rooted in German idealism, romanticism, gothic
took a wrong turn,
as in the 20th century, the practice of mass murder increased 
together with the protection of indiviual right.

The the Ill-Made Knight, gazing at the reflection of his ugly face in polished armour, 
"He was trying to find out what he was, and he was afraid of what he would find."<small>[]</small>

facing the horrors that reality is deceptive illusion, 
forever captured by the Geist, the supernatural figure, 
which haunts by being interpenetrive, only to be escaped in death.


interface may clone, manipulate, kill, from which it thinks is apparently independent

And although, a personal feeling of ownership, 
through the permissions of belonging to the group wheel.
imperial state, 



AI, chatgpt, machine learning added all the words from human environment 
but not the individual relations, 
leads to more and more distortion?
abolished social relation, interaction, 
the arsenals of culture, every social activity processed as objects.

There is only one mind, mind consceive itslef'unifying point /configuring factor'
(p2) mind has history, -> history of history, made up
not nature past?? no relation to anything??



Considered rationally, 
Bound in that, pure 'private' thoughts can not exist,  
 if being both personal and impersonal space.

Speech has been outsourced by abstract signs,
scripture to determine it, to make speech law.
imposed by the state alone.

justice
now the production of language. (garton), with aid of liberal tech bros
lots of words, with emphasis on form 


The interpretation of language, listening  carefully or deep reading
takes work /time, human errors so why not compute?

Deceptive algorithms for profit and benefit the rich, 


The crystal language of law is on the one hand is totally abstract, 
with the sole goal of total clarification, 
that is to abolish metaphor and make the signified REAL.

The liberal project insists on the right of freedom of speech, 
as long as it is without meaning,
true dumb phrases massage the ego, 
need no interpretation and Garton  "eclipse of action by language" or
"sign over signified" which resulted in the machine takeover.


instentanous anti social media of the 00s
mere re-action headlines, decline of political rhetoric
"The LLM represents, after all, the definitive automation of liberalism's 
central activity: the production of language." 

turing complete?? impossibility of completion > disastrous consequences

LLM produce only human writing form but no content (hallucinations)
once out, accelarate reproduction of even  more schwachsinn


aeveiternity, mode of being angel



"objective,precise, transpartent", quite the opposite
the transparency problem, coz bottomless, and this can be filled 
with subjective, vague and obscureness

for Garton, liberalism reigns, it's logic in language is to blame
souvereign flesh has been replaced by machinic language, 
spoken by robots
the people, who are on the one hand sick of blabla in parliament, 
but on the other open for short and catchy marketing slogans, 
to draw them one-sided.


freedom of speech, giving voice to express one's viewpoint
Are we allowed to critique modern democracy? no
political more restricted than ever
but critique, remain empty noise
because of morality replaced morals

liberal democracy, based on repre,sentation
left and right
what is the claim of unmediated, unreptesented general will_
only on paper, feeding the machine, dissolve in the arbitrary of linuistic sign
dismantling reality, 
strategies: all minority rights, can't be made in total (left)
'deconstruction', further bolloks, would direct against itself (right)
Garton



disease of affluence 
eternal growth, absolutely doesn't match with science and the laws of thermodynamics.
huge lies at the expense of nature and primitives.
