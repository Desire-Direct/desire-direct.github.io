At Goldsmiths I was taught, coding in Perl means individual improvisation,
tuning in on the constant negotiation of the body and its intrinsic function, 
and not falling for the Standard Error (STDERR) 
of the biological and technological divide. 
The band sets the inhuman rythm of our activity, 
intoning free radical vicissitudes all at once and
de-forming clusters of autonomous soft cells that ru(i)n wetware 
beyond instinct, 
which is both oppressor and promoter of endless possible engagements with chaos.
The cultured working class diaspora is placing terrific trust
in internal decisions made by the continous bloodstream of noise 
and vocalize its pulsations throughout Jungle and D'n'B, that resolve in vibrating <a href="https://fleeimmediately.com/02-danceandcode/verena/hermann/pogo-as-warfare.html">>dancehal_lucinations</a> and manifest in <i>bass materialism</i>.<small>[1]</small>
Unprofessional shots in de-coding account for high-frequency ricochets, 
sensed as acidic blows to the bonce, which offset alkaline beats 
at a pace that does not tolerate the resounding of a calcified past, 
but opens the mind by piercing through plasticized skins.
Acute wounds are deterritorial mappings for a future Now! 
that trigger a flight reflex within libidinal desiring-machines 
towards oceanic land and
away from the soaring hazard zones of eroticized chronic pain
and dicktated liberty.
The bleeding stigmata of schizophrenic vigor
outpour into keys for a new <del>re</del>productive sexuality, 
which is expressed in awkward agitations of dis_continuity.
A tumbler of cannibals is performing
rituals in flux manoeuvres of weird postures and uttered sound, 
appropriating in slack in_tension the repetitive tremors of shell shock
and living through
the sweet pains of orgasm denial just to pull out in GOOD time and
leaving the alien entities ovum and semen open to all its possibilities, 
savouring the fruit of your womb that is blessed as third, twisted carnal knowledge.

Savage Bataille is directly and fervently banging on
the unimaginable two-dimensional <b>in</b>tense membrane of base materialism,
and deprecates civilized entity for (ta)booing
the unconditional overspending of black, deep drumming, 
although capricious convulsions of matter
are shaping its white, ideal form of algorithmic pleasure and pain. 
"Where is the revenue of such tremendous social un-productivity?", 
the phenomenon may ask, 
as it exists on a balance sheet only, 
if appropriated for the principle of loss.<small>[2]</small>
The brutish emphasis on loss of actual value is
in lockstep with the primitive logic of past civilizations, 
which according to religious rite, 
sacrifice the Alive in expectations of a prosperous future,
all the while rooting deep into anastrophe, the sleepy nest of the native Old Ones, 
that is always open for catastrophe.
<i>Verausgabung</i> and <i>Vereinnahmung</i> are joint acts of ()hole inorganic, 
and based localhost shares its interest in destructive production 
with virtual remote, that is high from the downers of obscene pornography, 
which are everywhere free available over the counter.
<i>Non</i>sensical sexual violence 
is deflecting the function mind to focus on aroused anonymous materials and
provokes a radical empiricism, a beneficial
sensory training for desiring-machines to take a closer look 
 and immediately bring them to heel. Explicit, eroticised violence on the other hand, 
 is the (un)deliberate tactics of art and war to outshine sexuality and
push obscenities into light and obscurity, and the greater the spiritual decline, 
the more soars the symbolic worth of capital, which uncontrollably propagates pointless art and war.

<a href="https://github.com/Desire-Direct/assassin-rice/blob/master/scripts/love_poem">Gothic love_poem</a> is made of exercises while learning Perl. The art of code poetry was actually introduced to me by <a href="https://reneecarmichael.substack.com">Renee Carmichael</a>, who is not only my girl crush, but also a great inspiration.</p>
