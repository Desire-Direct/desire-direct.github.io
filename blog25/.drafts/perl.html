Renfield is the prototype of a modern brainsick
and slavishly adores master Dracula 
for he holds the insensible, 
uncanny power of manipulating blood
turning into robots

child-brain Dracula not gained 
the knowledge of manipulating cognitive functions
cause he never walked in daylight

Dr. John Sewards diagnosis of Renfield,
why dangerous if unselfish? no caution to himself and others.
when self fixed point (sitte?)
when duty is fixed point (sittlichkeit)
not centred within.
imbalance

Without subjective resilience weak, lack of orientatio, low self-confidence
shattered easily by Dracula, 
Renfield is prone to clinical vampirism 
vertrautes gesicht, mirror

Freud's psychoanalysis is commercial, sensation mongering imagery, 
or <i>Bild</i> for the intelligentsia, 
no depth 
but sloppy look and recapitulation of the surface of human abysses 

of the wise, devalued children of the earth. 
Individual only in relation to environment
and Völkerspsy, mimic the "succesful" norm.
hiding in strenght of the mass



connotation stoneageman as a dumb brute without empathy, 
without Freud German's virtues of Tuechtigkeit und Verstand,
but surely passed on traits to the monster which modernity has created. 
and their culture and laws,  are images thereof.




The alive open-ended schizo, is indistinguishable from change, [1]

At Goldsmiths I was taught, that coding in Perl is like jazz improvisation,
a language a combo of mind and body, 
for the sake of living, 
which offers uncountable possibilities at once,
in dialogue with everything technology.
unlike the otherwise than C purposeless eXistenZ Python.


Learning the art of decision making raising irr-responsible person, 
evaluation of chances 
and risk taking at the right time, 




learn the flexible operative technique of syntax, and a lexicon
bendable
which is evading articulation, disowns meaning, 
technology is a mere function, 
understanding is improbable, 
mere function, it is what it does. 
then bending for results



Is deemed uncool and unstable postmodernism, 
a chance not to be missed?
Not killing modern code, just adding subroutines, to change the course
a cowardish killer. 


the Unix culture of sharing semen, 
but raising the living creature is private matter,
and not a problem as with Frankenstein's wretch, 


True learning requires context, the bigger picture (Wall), 
world of many objects

or the toddler, is brought up to remain blind towards

the horror of motor highways, de-naturalized reservoirs, 
television, shopping malls, 
now shifted into cyber.
still sucking the breast, 
anxious
aware about not finding exit, it is 'not doing it'.

Fisher reveals the horrors of the possibility, 
Gothic materialism
that the individual is dead all along, 
just animated by in/external forces,
and-both vitalist and materialist ideas, 
electro-magnetism, gravity


Preindividual being "is not one but more than one", 
or what Nietzsche calls <i>Herkommen</i>,
regarded a filthy state, eternal return.
where and-both sex violence, has no meaning, only use.(Sitte)


The body is connected to the entire earth history, 

not evolution of one species, 
the observer count and study habits

disconnected from environment Herkommen, 
modernism is alien slime, in which humans suffocate, 
gravity it of the past,  which does not determine future 
determined future is excreted by alien.

where it is shameful to be a primitive bat,
but totally okay a civilized vampyre, 
   the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality and manners
the quasi-religions of the vampyre, 
hiding a variety of demons into one masked devil.


the individuated body is a
plurality consisting of uncountable autonomous parts, 
which the mind does not control, 
why is it individuated? formed by the mind (hylomorphism)
"life-long", process of individuation, onotgenesis

severed, a phantom pain, 
in a "Welt am Draht", 
the past-modern refuses to die, a finalized universe. 



20th century physics, Boomerism, 
 the world is not determenistic. game

 kill metaphysics causality, the past does not determine what happens next.
the world regular, yet not subject to universal laws


herrschaft des intellects über das object
unheimlich, new object one
but mind must seperate


The Modern is a cool, Cartesian technical apparatus 
of simplicity, reduction
program, which gives choice between black or white, 
to take sides of good and bad, 
depending on your local position in space.

the greater "precision" of "universal laws",
that blind data "John Doe" can agree on,
not disagree, 
the landfill is growing. 





(sonntag, story of the eye)

my $killer_tank, 
does not need root permissions to fire its code, 
leads to consequences in the material word.
(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through 
the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result.


to establish connection between machines, 
between reader and writer (Ballard).

a precise translation into human-readable language
must be kept as vague as possible,
to avoid a crash, 

after the crash, 
the more you know, increase of traffic, 
changes meaning radically.

The exploration of code and rising cultural sensibilty, 
 which invokes schizopathologies


You cannot unsee
natural = artificial language, 
both meaning and authorship remain in question,
 language is a function of the body




"gestemes" "phonemes", the former visual, the latter aural

subconscious act of assigning an arbitrary (variable?)
to an arbitrary effect.

AI reproduces language mechanically,
a recapitulation of original sources of information,
through instantaneous into secondary source, 
adapts to the accelerating politics of speed, 
under the false flag of democratization project, "good" intentions 
as it was with print and internet.
a mass digestion, 

Gil: 
the body as a means of direct expression 
of what can not be said with "natural language", 
mix of body and language, larynx
lack of signifiers,  most direct, less equivocal
like with Gesture? 

It gives user freedom to modify the open-source
focus on learning along the trip of the coding project,
which should emphasis needs and interests of the individual

the one pre-fixed destination for all, the electronic highway.
for broad virtual imagination and the endless possibilities, 
for sexual invention. 

perl/unix architecture pipes are open, by yourself,

In a statistical world, transparent is only the user, 
or the used, as a means for production and consumerism.
who is urged to stay at home with only its Windows open,
energy and images comes from nowhere, flying right in, 
reality
watching pornographic display.


everything else is hidden, behind the facade of 
convoluted electronic highways and the global amazon shopping mall. 


like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs

focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
not object-oriented

The postmodern is the immersion into the simulation of the video game, 

with 3D graphics you walk around the objects, 
various timelines available, interpret into smth new.



, that's when the theatre took over.


every symbol, from the alphabet, 
no matter how approached from different angles, remains inaccesible, 
a motley of universal visual signs that 
represent volatile individual, phonetic language of vulgar vowels. 

stays, modern 2D arcade game coin-operated, drive-in

Why does everything appear oversaturated color
gray monoculture?


in the third order of the Hyperreal
aufheben of difference
it is meaningless to question if fake or real, 
as everthing
reverts to the first order of the sign, simulacrum, 
a blatant image, not even a functional copy of the real. 


dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
real world scenario, non-deterministic nature
accident
the regulation and transformation into normal people,
everyone wants to be normal
and adapt to the simulation?
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction,


For Benjamin the base (material technical devices, digitalisation,)
advances with much more speed, accelerated by capital
transformation of superstructure, ("virtual simulation we live in ") 
?
"supernatural"
mechanical reproduction of a work of art
photography, accelerated to keep pace with speech (thought)
in an instant
photography before sound reproduction?
body/hand painting slow



Baudrillard Hyperreality, distinction real/fake is meaningless
no original, just a mix of data
visuals and sound in an instant, a mere sign, no time for interpretation


supression of instinctual needs, 
delay in satisfaction, (amok)
but in capitalism, immidiate satisfaction is the goal of progress
compatible with civilized society
Virilio:(3)expose the accident in Time
classical space ->time
crash with mind?

From the modernist viewpoint, 
technology is an extension of the body
both degraded to practical mediums, 

the former a weapon to battle nature (the body), 
the latter, 
the operational butler of the self-determined subject, 

submissively handling "external" tasks, "material" objects.

In this perverse cybernetic scenario, 
body and tech opposite, to regulate each other. 


Code is material, inherently causal, 
like the tiny autonomous software cell that ru(i)ns the wetware, 



The body is state-of-the art technology, 
instantaneous, chaos. 
In Crash, 
the body is the extension of death. 
the wounds? 

Crash is allegory, violent corpulation between body and tech
transformation in the new
(112)why violence done to tech
semiurgy, the expansion of the semiosphre, mass-mediated environments




the offensiveness flatness of mass language,
overboiling suppression of 
individual expression leads to 

controlled violence  car crash
'legal ways to kill one another'
perversity of war. 



In Crash, the car as not as outsourced object, 
but self-destruction, unify with the body.
both modifying the body and technology


J. G. Ballard writings is what Fisher would call 
"a materialist critique of Science Fiction from hypernaturalist horror",

Ballard is presenting us the body, 
not as a mere 
piece of cybernetic extension of nature/culture, as a open wound.

Unlike cyberpunk escapism into the endless, expanding vastness of the universe,
Ballard, trained medical,  
visualises the internal abyss function of the body 
and the expansion of cybernetic bodies on lame earth. 


Ballard writes sci-fi not in outer but inner space.

(Ballard, crash 6) wounds to a new sexuality, keys born from a new technology.


from satirical viewpoint 



what the real role in our lives.
It's a representative (simulacrum), of
physical /psychical, 

The infrastructure is a complex global machine, 
which determines the local movement, or non-movement of objects,
psychopathologies
which is visible, material/real? laid open in front of our eyes.


life on the one hand minimized, nanotech 
on the other /macromized, 
distorted relations


Why not see it? because it invasion in our bodies
schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 



but Ballard gives hope, 
Stelarc proposes, 
embodied and digital alterity,
with heightened I/O capabilities, 
</p>

<p>





true dat? body before? but the subject.

For Ballard and Baudrillard, other way round?(127)
Virilio (3), another feature the accident, 
what obstacles crop up, simulatneously

Crash is work of art, technoporn
serving the lewdness of male phantasies of lesbian, homosexual and violence, 
a repertoire of on repeat.

sexual porn organization principle, sexual politics (or operational? 127)
cybernetic?
the theatre at the base?
a parody of porn?

Crash, technology opens new sexual organs
the penis and vagina encountered everywhere

things that are different should look different

carnal=just discharge, no erregonous zone


porn and lit difference;(88)
Porn only to arouse the reader sexually, 
technology and violence?
complex possibilities of the world

postmodern does not kill anything, 
not in terms of aufheben, like the "modern" museum, 
the cool killer of history, that with its hard links, 
points only to one past.
Naturally digest, poop. growth

What happened, neolib
capital, attenuate possibilities, money in foreground
keeping the poop, not reinterpreting it, 
modern, in den Arsch beissen.
reversed cycle

ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 


critical modernist tradtion, 
emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and transparency of production.


reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork
