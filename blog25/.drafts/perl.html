Benjamin points out, that sense perception has changed in the history of man,

too much Lust /Unlust pathological
regulation through cybernetics.

Freud räumt auf mit wirren Gedankengängen!
Er ermöglicht 
unmögliche Analyse der individuellen Psyche 
mit übersichtlichen Bauklötzen und 
errichtet das Monument des psychischen Apparatus, das tausend Jahre überdauern soll, 
für EIN Id, EIN Ego, EIN Superego!

<p>
My readings of Freud throughout the past year confirmed my uneasy feelings, 
but I have to admit, that although I'm studying psychopathological systems theory, 

Freudian psychoanalysis, in line with Marx
provides the  manual, for observation and control of modern society 

He, who is counted among the Viennese avant-garde, 
a special unit of white men enthusiastic 
about acceleration of industrial boomerism,
and thus combating chance for alternatives and pushing prediction, 

praises the German virtue of efficiency and
diagnoses everyone who does not tick in the same economic tact with the machine, 
with mental illness, absurdly enough mit obsessive compulisive disorder (OCD), 

soon realized, 
there can be nothing done about the inherently chaotic nature of humankind,
so why not simplify 
which he situates in the mind
it contradicts the curative powers for individual mental health, 
but instead pulls the body and its burning passion to the generalized front line.

Freud in particular had his problems with the concept of <i>Totem und Tabu</i>, 
the otherwordly material mystery, 
which forms the base of any functioning society 
and stays in touch with psychedelic shamanic chemistry, 
but volatilizes through a soluble physics of psychotropic drugs. 


Freud illustrates his Lustprinzip as a stretched thera band, 
stresses that pain is the starting point of all human action, 
but instead of working out and strenghten the spine, 
suggests to release the tension of pain, by 
folding it into a flabby, closed cycle. (3/46)

Dismissing ~Entspannung
through the feel-good pain of stretching muscles of base matter
boundaries, flexible, to reach the toes, 
no matter how disgusting, always belong to you.

But sadly with health has no value, 
so why not create (ASMR), likes but ruins your body
avoidance of pain at any price


a lifestyle desired by just any American Psycho hardbody, 
who wants to play rich and give off a miasma of importance, 
where work equals humiliation, 
outsourced to the material world. 


dies due to sclerosis, 
to impress like-minded, rotting organic matter 


which kills all  burning desire, 
and which finds its outlet in violence.
Freud, instead of dysfunctional society,  blames his eroticised family as the cause of all problems, which established a typical 20th century nuclear family, 
with mechanical mama and papa, 0 and 1. 
economy and longlevity factors increase, health downhill
not into mass-production assembly line,(decrease fun)
one or two, mass-raising helicopter, 
who are in-active members of that very society, instead of 
protecting its young from its suffocation? 




the conservatives preserve its structure of the dead family, 
and Cord clamping (abnabelung) is critizised, 

in the web of the matrix no hard links, 
continuity-discontuinity, 

symlinks in simulation are not real, 
echoes from the past, 
lügen of causality a -> b, disturbed time

communication disorders, 
Azuma: family bands, don't like humans in general, 
but have to integrate into build society



Wahrnehmung /bewusste Wahrnehmung (perception/consciousness), subconciousness?
pleasure /unlust(pain) comes from W?

He is right, 
BW, event does not make long-lasting change, immediately but in thin air
as it's a border /interface
long lasting imprint, which fossil human

Neither pain nor pleasure does exist in the simulated mental state,(BW?), 
as it is felt, 
but physical /emotional pain/pleasure affects it thought, 
the latter soul, media manipulation


although of same type, human pain
is qualitiatively different 
private, compassion
degree of pain, subjective

pain invokes change, causes growth, scorn and surrender.
individuals and society alike. 


16/46 "erregungsvorgänge" in anderen Systems dauerspuren (trauma) memory, nothing to do with bewusstwerden. 
17/46 Freud claims, 
that processes are the most durable ones, when never came to Bewusstsein. 
(genes), engraved
hard to image, durable excitement, will form W-Bw
coz we need to forget

bewusstwerden und gedächtnisspur unvereinbar in the same system? (time?)


Freud places great emphasis on borders, cerebral cortex
which do not exist in the domain of chemistry

<i>Das Unheimliche</i> is in fact 
a crash between abstraction
thought <i>heimlich</i>, or taboo[] and the material body, 
a strange situation, 
strong feeling of uncomfortableness, realign
autority body. 
correct orientation? 
smth not belong here. 

definition, that what psychological core conditions must be met,
that unheimlich emerges?
the suppression of the body, or the other way round
balance?



the posthuman welcoming xeno, not so much freaked out, 
unheimlich what should be normal

optimized mass-manufactured mannequins, 
complex simulation prone to bugs and glitches 



In Perl, the
OR || logical operator, if left value wrong, the right not computed. 
greedy &&, 
left is already false not compute it (perl, 143)
Perl avoids garbage code, since left liberal centrism. 





at the same time, 
reinvent sex as sexuality, morals as morality
is coding a self-referent discipline(fuller, 88)
disciplinary formalization
language??


network, association and destruction are indistinct, 
(marcuse; uncontrolled ERos just as fatal as death instinct?)



using $variable before assigned a value, (37)
policing Perl assigns the undef value, 
which is of different kind scalar, 
the modern mind negative about.

which is neither 0, nor empty  but <b>acts</b> like it, 
and still runs the infinite loop, to accumulate data.


<pre>./media</pre>

organs orbiting the construct nervous system, 
and susceptible to biological impulse rather than
mere sensation. 


Azuma: cyberspace, cyberpunk William Gibson, switch in and out, 
Ballard, explores inner space, 
cyberspace cannot invade  the body, 
what looks like the invasion of alien technology into the carnal, 
is its homeland, ruled independent from the mind. 

Bataille: eroticism, immediate aspcet of inner experiene, contrast to animal sexuality?



Is a/stable roadkill, 
a roasted rag rug of dead matter, which renounced sunscreen products, 
a performing entity, flattened by wind, not to be missed out on?

Ballard's Crash is  neither dystopian nor utopian, but beckons hope, 
the electronic highway is alive, emanicpatory for the mind. 




the interface is the logic of difference, 
between decision maker 0 and 1, 
decision via simulation, no distinction
relation is two

<p>
In Perl, with warn(), taking action is always too late, 
as it runs the code anyway, internal compiler preemptively simulate the run.(16, perl)
the ()die function, stops it, "getting out of a program earlier than normal"(152)
and thus protects from

Death is the end of the world is a local event, 
and everyone (image/simulation) is dying with you. 
genocide




James wants to live, break out of negative cybernetic loop of 
drives repetitively the motorway, until positive feedback of Crash. 
anticapated change, like in concrete island, only possible
through the dis-continuity /continuity of the  car crash. 
is conditioned by death 





(Roden)
the physical state = mental state.
not private, but belongs to the whole body (universe)
the inside /body not under control

but marcuse says 
human libido (energy) flows thru structure of animal drives
under the influence of external reality

Why would anyone using computers, if we really fear the Crash?<small>[]</small>

At first blush, the novice might regard <i>Crash</i>,
with its unconventional coupling of the car crash and sexuality, 
as a most spectacular example of obscenity; 
on a more advanced level and on virginal reading, perhaps as
the most boring program Ballard has ever written.
But do fuck around and find out, 
that <i>Crash</i> software is
one of the most interesting and virulent works of science fiction [SF].<small>[2]</small>


With terseness and elegance
it schizo computes the postmodern condition, 
of both hyper-sensation and -ennui,

parsing through the databases of homoerotic lewdness 
and technological landscapes in a pornographic loop of violence.









Corny porn begins with clumsy encounters, very popular is a crash 
of two distinct <i>character classes</i><small>[]</small>
which without foreplay, 
straight enact gender-specific sexual intercourse.
now, neither character, classless society

destabilize the psychotic opposition of high or low, opening the dimensions of real time

[] Ballard, New Wave of science fiction
the undervalued here and now
and inner space. 


technology as a weapon to hit the body,
calculate its future position to shoot it up, 
mere trajectories of identities rising over time.


timeless, 
vocabulary working over many application, crossing categories
the modern = now, see Wall;
time, porn, now, but we are not enjoying the now
no more relax, relax means vulnerable (ellis)
why is everyone so tense, the next, the next, orgasm
devaluation of life as it happens, 

god's calculation are patterns of incompleteness, inequality, injustice (deleuze)
a short program individual life, fundamental incomplete(fuller, 89)
without the world around


gene editing share identical past and future 
Deleuze, (221)
pre-quantitiave and pre-qualitative dramatization, 
makes possible sufficient reason (and carries potentiallity in the idea)
maybe similar with Artaud, 

posthuman trap, a pre-established set of possibilities



death drive, finally obsolete body dies?


Cronenberg made a feature-length postmodern fusion
between glossy advertisment and documentary on contemporary cybernetic culture
in cool blue hue.

I made this tarot card in 2021, expressing anxiety and inner turmoil at that time 
in a different, unintentional painting technique. 

The idea, after reading lots of Ballard, 
and pictures,  which were documenting the aftermath of a car accident my father had in the 1980s. 
A meme of despair, no internet
I titled the card Divinol, a lubricant, which was shown on one of the photographs.  
but encrypted it with a weird writing system,
