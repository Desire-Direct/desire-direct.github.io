programming noob, 
languages only differ in syntax,
web use, screen
calculation?

Perl works well in the shell, 
perl a digested and simplified version of unix
more functional rather than cool.

Gesture? like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs

My teacher once said, it's like jazz, 
improvise, and goes along with 
Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it.

raising responsible person, require to make a choice,
good /bad, feel the outcome?
black-white, discuss in gray

emphasis on the capabilities and interests of the individual
And thus can lead to a completety different outcome, journey.
romanticism

My learning problems, addressed by Wall,
pupils need context, the bigger picture
which never Bavarian education system, not interested 
reduced to data, 
not mass language?
solution centred, not the learning process matters, but the outcome(209)




individual choices, not like kants thingy, not everyone should agree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
subroutine??
black and white
deconstructism  bridge betwee modernism and postmodernism
modernism simplicity, reduction??
postmodernism all at once (alina popa)




Wall does not shun
Postmodernism, mix culture, 
but turned into monoculturalism, for the mass.
because of aufheben of difference

"universal law", everyone can agree on
not offending, where does this lead to
Postmodern 'uncool' 

the past-modern refuses to die, 
how can it if new and now, anyway?

but also the postmodern refuses to kill the modern
postmodern does not kill anything, aufheben.
not bad, 
ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 

death of History, hard links


Materiality (209), 
two machines connected, reader and writer
writing code or language, is action
leads to consequences in the material word
execution, fire code, 
kill real people, drone strike

relations between matter
from material conditions reality,
office workers, 
solutions, 

Modernism, cult of originality, 
a total break from herkommen, as if shameful to be a monkey,
reinvent everything
architecture=functional

postmodern not to justify with reason
culmination, circle
neither good or bad
modernism, fashion, now no fashion, monoculturism


ductwork, how can i see this in perl?
things that are different should look different

hammer everything looks like a nail, modernism, not look whats being pounded
focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
perl the submissive butler
programmer, decision maker

not object-oriented


Lucy: always or, never and.




natural /artificial lingo = bs
meaning and authorship remain in question

(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result. T

Larry Wall, perl postmodern language.
modernist culture about 'or' rather than 'and', 
postmodern culture reversed
critical modernist tradtion, emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and 
transparency of production.
Marshall Berman; All that is Solid Melts into Air
dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction
modernity=incomplete project, how can it complete?
postmodernity, deferring, stall
