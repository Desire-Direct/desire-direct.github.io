Perl is "free-form language"[learning perl]
perl postmodern language.
My teacher once said, it's like improvisational jazz, 
, Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it.

The distinction natural /artificial lingo is bs, 
both meaning and authorship remain in question.

perl/unix pipes are open, 
modern transparent is only the open source, 
all other is 
hidden, stay home with only your Windows open.
transparent is only the user 
as a means for production and consumerism.

freedom to modify it on a journey,
functional, rather than outcome

Gil: 
body expression of what can not be expressed with 
"natural language"
lack of signifiers,  most direct, less equivocal
like with Gesture? 
mix of body and language

materiality of body code

like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs


Learn as you go along with life and your coding project
emphasis on needs and interests of the individual
And thus can lead to a completety different outcome, journey.
invention, broad virtual imagination
romanticism, individual in relation to the absolute (Grant?)

raising responsible person, require to make individual choices,
evaluation for individ and society?
Wall: 
not everyone should agree, but at least disagree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
add subroutine??

The Modern is a cool, technical apparatus 
of simplicity, reduction
program, which gives choice between black and white, 
to take sides of good and bad, 
depending on your local position in space.

the greater "precision" of "universal laws",
that blind data "John Doe" can agree on, 
the greater the side effects


offending flatness of mass language,
suppression of individual expression leads to violence 


the past-modern refuses to die, 

Liberated learners need context, the bigger picture (Wall)
or 'not doing it', 

the modern society not given, innovation in gray, monoculture
removing diversity, the plague,  
language, control and precision

J. G. Ballard is rethinking 
bodies and space,
with psychopathology.
by writing on the global communication infrastructure, 
of motor highways, aeroplane, television, shopping malls
which determines local movement, or non-movement
which is visible, material/real? laid open in front of our eyes.

Why not see it?
schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 

Why is code material?
It connects machines, simplified the reader and writer
permissions to execute,fire code, 
leads to consequences in the material word, 
a killer. 



(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result.



The body is a
plurality consisting of uncountable autonomous parts, 
the mind does not control, why is it individuated? 


The body is related to the entire earth history, 
or what Nietzsche calls Herkommen,
filthy times, where
sex, and-both crash/violence, has no meaning, only use.(Sitte)


Modern detached, 
20th century physics, the world is not determenistic.
kill metaphysics causality, the past does not determine what happens next.
the world regular, yet not subject to universal laws

invented a new base, industrialization
Benjamin: transform of substructure ("human culture") 
far more slowly than base (tools, machines)



porn organization principle, 
in a "virtual world", whic  opposite to the real, 
life on the one hand minimized, 
on the other /macromized, 
distorted relations







relations between matter
from material conditions reality,
office workers, 
solutions, 


postmodern not to justify with reason
culmination, circle
neither good or bad
modernism, fashion, now no fashion, monoculturism


ductwork, how can i see this in perl?
things that are different should look different

hammer everything looks like a nail, modernism, not look whats being pounded
focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
perl the submissive butler
programmer, decision maker

not object-oriented


Lucy: always or, never and.







Fisher asks in his thesis, are we all dead, 
just animated by external forces?



Is the Postmodern, a missed opportunity?
deemed 'uncool', 
cowardly defers solution to kill the modern
focus on endless discussion, 

dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction,
because of aufheben of difference
modern is the new, but also transitional space
cutting off past and future


Unix culture of sharing seeds, cultivation is your problem.


postmodernism adapts more real world,
offers many possibilities at once,
3D perspective, from space various timelines, interpret into smth new.
mix and grow the plants, for your colourful plot. 
not ready for this, boomer parents


postmodern does not kill anything, 
not in terms of aufheben, like the "modern" museum, 
the cool killer of history, that with its hard links, 
points only to one past.
Naturally digest, poop. growth

What happened, neolib
capital, attenuate possibilities, money in foreground
keeping the poop, not reinterpreting it, 
modern, in den Arsch beissen.
reversed cycle

ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 


critical modernist tradtion, 
emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and transparency of production.

Modernism, Boomerism marks the total break from herkommen, 
it is shameful to be a monkey,
but not Nazis with manners, 
the quasi-religions of aliens, 
the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality
demons into one masked devil, 
preindividual being "is not one but more than one"

reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork
