Is perl a postmodern language?
My teacher once said, it's like improvisational jazz, 
, Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it,
well, there are rules, operative technique
syntax

functional, 

It gives user freedom to modify 
focus on learning along the trip of the coding project,
which should emphasis needs and interests of the individual
rather than one pre-fixed destination for all. 
the broad virtual imagination
the endless possibilities, for true invention

perl/unix architecture pipes are open, by yourself,

In modernism, if you're lucky,  transparent is only the open source, 
transparent is only the user, 
as a means for production and consumerism.
everything else is hidden, stay at home with only your Windows open.


The distinction natural /artificial lingo is bs, 
both meaning and authorship remain in question.
Gil: 
body expression of what can not be expressed with 
"natural language"
lack of signifiers,  most direct, less equivocal
like with Gesture? 
mix of body and language

like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs

focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
not object-oriented


raising responsible person, require to make individual choices,
evaluation for individ and society?
Wall: 
not everyone should agree, but at least disagree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
add subroutine??
the Unix culture of sharing seeds, cultivation is your problem.
but if in prison?
mix and grow the plants, for your colourful plot. 
not ready for this, boomer parents

</p>

<p>
Is the deemed 'uncool', Postmodern, a missed opportunity?
cowardly deferring solution to finish the modern.
The posthuman schizo, in controast to the boomer psycho,
adapts to change far better, open for surprise
focus on simultaneously on endless possibilities, in dialogue with everything

Life-long Learners needs context, the bigger picture (Wall)
or the toddler, needs to explore the world, or is 'not doing it'.


The hyperreality of postmodernism adapts more real world,
offers many perspectives at once,
 immersed into a video game, with 3D graphics if you walk around the objects, 
various timelines, interpret into smth new.
unlike, modern 2D arcade game coin-operated, drive-by


Why does everything appear on the varnished surface as gray monoculture?
, the theatre took over.

because of aufheben of difference
there can not be difference, 
in the third order of the Hyperreal
as meaningless of fake or real, as everthing
reverts to the first order of the sign, simulacrum, 
a blatant image, not even a functional copy of the real. 


dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
quantum physics, wrong 
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction,



repudiate simulated basis of 
Speed
For Benjamin the base (material technical devices, digitalisation,)
advances with much more speed
transformation of superstructure, ("virtual simulation we live in ") 





</p>


<p>
materiality of body code
Why is code material?
It connects machines, simplified the reader and writer
permissions to execute,fire code, 
leads to consequences in the material word, a killer. 
(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result.


But advanced internal technology of the body, 
instantaneous, chaos
not understood?

Virilio:(3)expose the accident in Time
classical space ->time



In Crash, the body is the extension of death (verl√§ngerung)
illusion of lost unity of the subject (abject?)
the wounds? 
Crash is allegory, violent corpulation between body and tech
transformation in the new
(112)why violence done to tech
semiurgy, the expansion of the semiosphre, mass-mediated environments


preindividual being "is not one but more than one"
20th century physics, Boomerism, 
 the world is not determenistic. game

 kill metaphysics causality, the past does not determine what happens next.
the world regular, yet not subject to universal laws




The Modern is a cool, Cartesian technical apparatus 
of simplicity, reduction
program, which gives choice between black or white, 
to take sides of good and bad, 
depending on your local position in space.

the greater "precision" of "universal laws",
that blind data "John Doe" can agree on,
not disagree, 
the landfill is growing. 


the offensiveness flatness of mass language,
overboiling suppression of 
individual expression leads to 

controlled violence  car crash
'legal ways to kill one another'
perversity of war. 


J. G. Ballard writings is what Fisher would call 
"a materialist critique of Science Fiction from hypernaturalist horror",

Ballard is presenting us the body, 
not as a mere 
piece of cybernetic extension of nature/culture.

Unlike cyberpunk escapism into the endless, expanding vastness of the universe,
Ballard, trained medical,  
visualises the internal abyss function of the body 
and the expansion of cybernetic bodies on lame earth. 


From the modernist viewpoint, technology is the weapon against "nature", 
the extension of the body (Cartesian, cybernetic)
the body reduced to a functional medium, 
the operational butler of the subject, 
submissively handling, "external", material objects.


from satirical viewpoint 



what the real role in our lives.
It's a representative (simulacrum), of
physical /psychical, 

The infrastructure is a complex global machine, 
which determines the local movement, or non-movement of objects,
psychopathologies
which is visible, material/real? laid open in front of our eyes.


life on the one hand minimized, nanotech 
on the other /macromized, 
distorted relations


Why not see it? because it invasion in our bodies
schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 






but Ballard gives hope, 
Stelarc proposes, 
embodied and digital alterity,
with heightened I/O capabilities, 
</p>

<p>
Fisher asks in his thesis, if we are all dead, 
just animated by in/external forces,
true if we are not blind to see @Ballard's notion
of the horror of motor highways, de-naturalized reservoirs, 
television, shopping malls, 
now shifted into cyber.

The body is a
plurality consisting of uncountable autonomous parts, 
the mind does not control, why is it individuated? 

The body is connected to the entire earth history, 
severed, a phantom pain, 
in a "Welt am Draht", 
the past-modern refuses to die, a finalized universe. 

or what Nietzsche calls Herkommen,
filthy times, where
sex, and-both crash/violence, has no meaning, only use.(Sitte)
eternal return.

There is not a total break from Herkommen, 
modernism is alien slime, humans suffocate, 
gravity it of the past 
determined future hold by the lizards.

where it is shameful to be a civilized monkey,
but totally okay a primitive Nazis with manners,   
morality the quasi-religions of aliens, 
the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality
variety of demons into one masked devil.




true dat? body before? but the subject.

For Ballard and Baudrillard, other way round?(127)
Virilio (3), another feature the accident, 
what obstacles crop up, simulatneously

Crash is work of art, technoporn
serving the lewdness of male phantasies of lesbian, homosexual and violence, 
a repertoire of on repeat.

sexual porn organization principle, sexual politics (or operational? 127)
cybernetic?
the theatre at the base?
a parody of porn?

Crash, technology opens new sexual organs
the penis and vagina encountered everywhere

things that are different should look different

carnal=just discharge, no erregonous zone


porn and lit difference;(88)
Porn only to arouse the reader sexually, 
technology and violence?
complex possibilities of the world

postmodern does not kill anything, 
not in terms of aufheben, like the "modern" museum, 
the cool killer of history, that with its hard links, 
points only to one past.
Naturally digest, poop. growth

What happened, neolib
capital, attenuate possibilities, money in foreground
keeping the poop, not reinterpreting it, 
modern, in den Arsch beissen.
reversed cycle

ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 


critical modernist tradtion, 
emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and transparency of production.


reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork
