Perl is "free-form language"[learning perl]
perl postmodern language.
My teacher once said, it's like improvisational jazz, 
, Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it.

The distinction natural /artificial lingo is bs, 
both meaning and authorship remain in question.

perl/unix pipes are open, 
modern transparent is only the open source, 
all other is 
hidden, stay home with only your Windows open.
transparent is only the user 
as a means for production and consumerism.

freedom to modify it on a journey,
functional, rather than outcome

Gil: 
body expression of what can not be expressed with 
"natural language"
lack of signifiers,  most direct, less equivocal
like with Gesture? 
mix of body and language

materiality of body code

like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs


Liberated learners need context, the bigger picture (Wall)
or 'not doing it', 
Learn as you go along with life and your coding project
emphasis on needs and interests of the individual
And thus can lead to a completety different outcome, journey.
invention, broad virtual imagination
romanticism, individual in relation to the absolute (Grant?)

raising responsible person, require to make individual choices,
evaluation for individ and society?
Wall: 
not everyone should agree, but at least disagree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
add subroutine??

<p>
The Modern is a cool, Cartesian technical apparatus 
of simplicity, reduction
program, which gives choice between black or white, 
to take sides of good and bad, 
depending on your local position in space.

the greater "precision" of "universal laws",
that blind data "John Doe" can agree on,
not disagree, 
the landfill is growing. 


the offensiveness flatness of mass language,
overboiling suppression of 
individual expression leads to 

controlled violence  car crash
'legal ways to kill one another'
perversity of war. 


Science fiction, cybergothic writer J. G. Ballard is rethinking 
bodies and technology in space,

by writing on the architecture of motor highways, 
aeroplane, television, shopping malls

what the real role in our lives.
It's a representative (simulacrum), of
physical /psychical, 

The infrastructure is a complex global machine, 
which determines the local movement, or non-movement of objects,
psychopathologies
which is visible, material/real? laid open in front of our eyes.

Why not see it? because it invasion in our bodies
schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 




repudiate its basis


but Ballard gives hope, 
Stelarc proposes, 
embodied and digital alterity,
with heightened I/O capabilities, 


</p>

<p>
Fisher asks in his thesis, are we all dead, 
just animated by external forces?
Why is code material?
It connects machines, simplified the reader and writer
permissions to execute,fire code, 
leads to consequences in the material word, a killer. 
(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result.



The body is a
plurality consisting of uncountable autonomous parts, 
the mind does not control, why is it individuated? 


The body is connected to the entire earth history, 
a phantom pain
in a "Welt am Draht", 

or what Nietzsche calls Herkommen,
filthy times, where
sex, and-both crash/violence, has no meaning, only use.(Sitte)


Modernism, is not a total break from Herkommen, 
where it is shameful to be a civilized monkey,
but totally okay a primitive Nazis with manners,   
morality the quasi-religions of aliens, 
the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality
variety of demons into one masked devil.

It glues to Herkommen, 
modernism is alien slime, 
gravity it of the past 
determined future hold by the lizards.

the past-modern refuses to die, 

preindividual being "is not one but more than one"
20th century physics, Boomerism, 
 the world is not determenistic.
kill metaphysics causality, the past does not determine what happens next.
the world regular, yet not subject to universal laws

dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
quantum physics, wrong 
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction,
because of aufheben of difference



invented a new base, industrialization
Benjamin: transform of substructure ("human culture") 
far more slowly than base (tools, machines)



porn organization principle, sexual politics
Lucy: always or, never and.

life on the one hand minimized, 
on the other /macromized, 
distorted relations




postmodern not to justify with reason
culmination, circle
neither good or bad
modernism, fashion, now no fashion, monoculturism


ductwork, how can i see this in perl?
things that are different should look different

hammer everything looks like a nail, modernism, not look whats being pounded
focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
perl the submissive butler
programmer, decision maker

not object-oriented


Is the deemed 'uncool', Postmodern, a missed opportunity?
cowardly defers solution to kill the modern.
The postmodern, posthuman, schizo, goes along with digital, 
focus on endless possibilities, in dialogue with everything

The hyperreality of postmodernism adapts more real world,
offers many possibilities at once,
3D perspective, if you walk around the objects, space
2D  drive-by


various timelines, interpret into smth new.

Why everything appears as gray monoculture?
the Unix culture of sharing seeds, cultivation is your problem.
but if in prison?
mix and grow the plants, for your colourful plot. 
not ready for this, boomer parents






postmodern does not kill anything, 
not in terms of aufheben, like the "modern" museum, 
the cool killer of history, that with its hard links, 
points only to one past.
Naturally digest, poop. growth

What happened, neolib
capital, attenuate possibilities, money in foreground
keeping the poop, not reinterpreting it, 
modern, in den Arsch beissen.
reversed cycle

ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 


critical modernist tradtion, 
emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and transparency of production.


reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork
