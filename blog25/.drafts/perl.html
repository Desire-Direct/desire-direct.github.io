At Goldsmiths I was taught, coding in Perl means individual improvisation,
tuning in on the constant negotiation 
of the body and its intrinsic function, 
and not falling for the Standard Error (STDERR) 
of the biological and technological divide. 

The band sets the inhuman digital rythm of our activity, 
free radical vicissitudes all at once, 
as in Jungle, 
before human instinct engaged with chaos and modulated its frequencies, 
D'n'B. 

the analogue transmission medium is connected to, 
a language of the dynamic interzone of body and spirit, 

Kittler writes, articulate code, or disappear under it completely(kittler, 40)
why not, on the one hand, 
roaring dinosaur, low frequency drone metal
on the other, meme

Code finite set of symbols, 
we mapped code
mapped same frequency onto suitable signal sequence, mind (kittler)

"codes materialize in processes of encryption" (Kittler, 40)
the human mind, to become "reality",

code is in sequence over time

Coding as a wilfurl immersion into a dream, 

space tourism<small>[]</small> for a brief dislocation /orientation
to the oceanic planet where cosmic reality constructs itself. 

haunted by your ghosts of the past, 

, moving to and fro, re /deteriolization
to get "the bigger picture", 

listen to seductive, unhomely alien, predictable melodies, 
and not doing it, 
sequenced tune. 
spaceship, wrong arch, selective


where meaning and purpose must remain in question.
to stimulate ex(<$change>);
the basic function of communication technologies.
to afford production of knowledge. 





all human is transformed to fit into the machine 
not to participate free software, 
science said unstable (chance)
but die




The producers of reality, operative, 
their access to knowledge based on profit
split(), and miniaturization (chips, genetics) 
knowledge
exteriorisation (extension), erotication
cybernetic


a cruel cybernetic mise-en-scene, 
technology as a weapon to hit the body,
calculate its future position to shoot it up, 
mere trajectories of identities rising over time.
The electronic highway is alive, 
the modern paradigm of standards
(STDIN) which are typically interactions with keyboard and mouse, 
cybernetic calcultion, 

Standard Output (STDOUT), the screen.
the filehandle acts between internal perl process and outside world.
in the public, "nothing to see here"


knowledge is product, to be sold


Over time, thought 
quantities of information
transnormed into (de)finite sequenced symbols, 	
a protection from madness, becomes the very same, 
thus madness only cure. 




rendered onto the screen
"file does not exist" is a truth. 


The algorithm, 
the operatic technique by which a not necesserily a task is to be accomplished (geoff, 15)
but action, 
which makes the 
distinction between artificial and natural language obsolete.

The modern is associated with elegance,

banality of evil,

complexity is the problem.

postmodern deconstruction of the structure, bare cables


with the
OR || logical operator, if left value wrong, the right not computed. 

logical operator \&&
left is already false not compute it (perl, 143)
Perl avoids garbage code, since left liberal centrism. 


Fuller points to the politics of elegance,[]

simply solving a "problem" simply from ONE  
out of billions puzzling realities 





but unison of autonomous software cell that ru(i)ns the wetware of the body
the body is not complex at all, 
material running by 0 and 1, a pure abstract of sex.

but to compute it, must be hard, 
from simplicity to complexity and back again. 
to achieve a different kind of abstraction

by making it easy, 
overcomplicated postmodern condition. 


coding, is the more self-referent discipline, 
the more in countless possibilities. personal numbering practice
outsourced institunialized math
AI has countless poss, singularity

The mind ignores striking inconsistencies across time at the bottom,
rearrange pipe through conscious decision, 
conjuring dark magic

Perl philsophy "no unnecessary limits"(perl, 41)

sci-fi time traveller alters past, new futures

policing Perl assigns the undef value, 
which is of different kind scalar,

which is neither 0, nor empty  but <b>acts</b> like it,

there are always two sides of the same coin,

<p>
libidinal surface skin, which makes ugly things look good and vice versa, 
cult around objectivity

worn-out skins, which stretched over time with the human mind, 


Lyotard and Stelarc are strong proponents of opening the human organism, 
with multiplicity of agents, or 
organs orbiting the body, 
with pipes subjectively, without objective dis/reconnected at will .(Stelarc, 132)

why not more operational (Stelarc suggests, 132)?

not morph with technological capabilities of the body. 
real-time computation and communication, 
to probe the outside, with whetted sensors
extension of the body, gripper abyss

Is a/stable roadkill, 
a roasted rag rug of dead matter, which renounced sunscreen products, 
a performing entity, flattened by wind, not to be missed out on?

AGI destroys culture
culture destroys instincts

post, on one hand, good 'and',

but if remains accumulation of data
a scrap heap, on which Crash victims praciticng intercourse, 
where or, ??? and making modern 
decisions. 


In Perl, with warn(), taking action is always too late, 
as it runs the code anyway, internal compiler preemptively simulate the run.(16, perl)
the ()die function, stops it, "getting out of a program earlier than normal"(152)
and thus protects from

Death is the end of the world is a local event, 
and everyone (image/simulation) is dying with you. 




the physical state = mental state.
not private, but belongs to the whole body (universe)


</p>


<p>
despite its violence, crash, physical and emotional pain, 
a mere clinical analysis. The way doctors write. 
Ballard's psychopathology 

subjective pain
qualitiatively different but of same type
degree of pain
posthuman, it is like already dead matter react on stress, 
nervous system expressing its desires in contracting muscle fibres. 


Pain does not exist in the simulated mental state, 
neoX


Computation, 
no compassion, 
but let people physically experience their mental state, 
abstract computing to intervene with the material world.
"abstraction to intervene with real life" (goeffey)

abject pain, interwines bread

subjective Pain, invokes change, causes growth, scorn and surrender.
different person /society. 

a painful experience does collapse the convenient distinction between the mind and body"
(suspension stelarc)

</p>


<p>
pain builds walls in the outside world? atomization
war, class

Are we all dead? zombie bodies, nervous system

The performing algorithms Cathrine and James Ballard, 
are so streamlined, encelagraph flatline.

body politics

feminine desire "regress towards the inorganic", 
(Luciana) 
masculine desire to operate, organs to the sun


Crash is positive feedback,
break free from the negative cybernetic loop, 
that life is conditioned by death 
media

</p>

<p>

the body opened willingly to the internet, 
which pierced the disposable, worn item skin, 
creating endless new interfaces, for alternate new worlds

and ousted the I, 
hyperstition, 
shoved between the con-joined monozygotic twins body and technology, 
are both degraded to practical mediums for application I/O

</p>


<pre>
Why would anyone using computers, if we really fear the Crash?<small>[1]</small>
</pre>

<i>Crash</i> seems somewhat uncanny<small>[2]</small> at first blush,
even the most boring program Ballard has written, 

the unformatted database in a loop of 
of homoerotic lewdness and technological landscapes 
airports, motorways and reservoirs, rendered on just below 300 screens. 


the obscene coupling of crash and sexuality, 
makes it most interesting works of ?fiction, 
(reverse function to the construe literature)


Cronenberg feature-length 
glossy advertisment and documentary
on anomie,[3] 
transgression

is to arouse radical empiricism, to forget one moment thought?

the deficiancy of instinctual needs, 
at its core the production of carnal knowledge, 
through collision and compulsion


animal Vaughn, displays most morbid of behaviour,
possessed 
mentally ill James Ballard cannot unsee the increased traffic after the Crash, 

his habit of traversing the motorway, 
city, always change, hell

human circulation, transportation system,
culture, laid open in front of our eyes

Capital
(marcuse, constraint is the very precondition of progess, 
left free to nature, no long relation /preservation 
(only for human thought, coz we cant see in depth)


sex is filthy business, morality

"Western" civilisation, founded in capital, 
made this constraint for human, 
immidiate gratifcation is the goal of progress,
always crashing, 
which conflates with  unbound "nature"

Crash / Sex is the obscure chemistry of constantly producing the new, 
association and destruction are indistinct, 
(marcuse; uncontrolled ERos just as fatal as death instinct?)

true civil renounces this. 

and robs the posthuman species from the joys of orgasm denial, 
clean culture lacks arousal, no climax, flat

la chambre obscure (only sex, when the common is different)


long lasting imprint, which fossil human


in the laboratory, mutant breeding

not reproduction as 
in the sado-masochistic cycle of bio-informatic sexuality grounded in captial.



Crash technology is the extension of death, writes Baudrillard,
which is beckoning from a dimension of depth, 
or non-sequential time, 
accesible for the human mind, petit mort and dream?

posthuman, a simulation of human mind
transhuman, body modification to live longer

the lack of knowledge leads to, insecurity
The hostility, xenophopia towards the body and technology? 
threating with death 


what looks like the invasion of external technology into the carnal, 
is its homeland, ruled independent from the mind. 



not necessarily rot, death commodity, 
keeping the comatose alive. 







For them, without heimlich, nothing is unheimlich,
and traumatic experience in a loop of catastrophic events  remains always the same (jentsch)

gene editing share identical past and future 

startled by the slightest glitch


narrator unfuckable Ballard, anally penetrated Vaughn, his alter ego, 

its degree of weirdness is modulated 
by the impact of Crash between colliding bodies and technology 

in their mutual deformation, imprints 
"symbolic wounds"
open surprising sexual possibilities.
or posthuman possibility space (PPS)(Roden)




or reading it against
the common, "objective", mind-dependent world, 
a simulation of a collective, conditioned mind.



bodies the beckoning transmittors of relay post system,

<p>



The alive, qualitative spirit of language, unsolvable dynamic shifting patterns 
of stylized postures and uttered sound, 
in which the blind mimick and test the milleu for orientation
is a mutable format. 

Vulgar vowels and click consonants, 

sound is immediate reproduction in motion, 
distorted echoes of past, 
anthropomorphized dualistic mode propagating sound onto static letters, 
, to be seen not felt.


milleu of changing material atmoshpere (aira), into vaccum of computed simulation.

which seemed the the wrong approach to tackle eternity.

<p>
<i>Das Unheimliche</i> is in fact 
thought in collides with <i>heimlich</i>, or taboo[], 
transcendental with the material of the body.
not belong here. 

Trauma, disorientation in strange situations, 
 strong feelings of uncomfortableness, 


qualtiatively ?? 
what did Jentsch, same type
eerieness
quantitative


definition, that what psychological core conditions must be met,
that unheimlich emerges?
the suppression of the body

re- establish connection with our alienated bodies, 
radical through technology


the posthuman welcoming xeno, not so much freaked out, 
unheimlich what should be normal
daily structure, 
just optimizing the habit (latin), 
different, strange ways.
integrating the old and the new. 


complex simulation prone to bugs and glitches

I made this tarot card in 2021, expressing anxiety and inner turmoil at that time 
in a different, unintentional painting technique. 

The idea, after reading lots of Ballard, 
and pictures,  which were documenting the aftermath of a car accident my father had in the 1980s. 
I titled the card Divinol, a lubricant, which was shown on one of the photographs.  
but encrypted it with a weird writing system,
