Gesture? like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs

My teacher once said, it's like jazz, 
improvise, learn as you go along with the project
Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it.

First of all raising responsible person, require to make a choice,
good /bad, feel the outcome?
black-white, discuss in gray
individual choices, not like kants thingy, not everyone should agree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
subroutine??
black and white
deconstructism  bridge betwee modernism and postmodernism
modernism simplicity, reduction??
postmodernism all at once (alina popa)


"universal law", everyone can agree on
not offending, where does this lead to
Postmodern 'uncool' 



emphasis on the capabilities and interests of the individual
And thus can lead to a completety different outcome, journey.
invention, virtual imagination
romanticism, individual in relation to the absolute (Grant?)

addressed by Wall,
learners need context, the bigger picture
'not doing it', for what?

reduced to data, 
not mass language?
solution centred, not the learning process matters, but the outcome(209)

more functional rather than cool Python.


Wall does not shun Postmodernism, 
mix culture from various timelines, interpret into smth new.

but turned into monoculturalism, for the mass.
because of aufheben of difference

the past-modern refuses to die, 
how can it if new and now, anyway?

but also the postmodern refuses to kill the modern
postmodern does not kill anything, aufheben.
not bad, attenuate (abschw√§chen) instead of reinterpret 
ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 

death of History, hard links


The "virtual world" opposite to the real, 
Fisher asks in his thesis, are we all dead, 
just animated by external forces?
The body, entity consisting of uncountable autonomous parts

McKenzie:
the bigger picture
global communication infrastructure, 
applies also to Ballards motor highways, aeroplane, television
determines local movement, or non-movement
visible functional ductwork, laid open
psychopathologies
television (fake)

schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 
in computing, perl/unix pipes are open, 
transparent? 
hidden, stay home with only your Windows open
transparent is only the user for consumerism.
what is going on, 

Crash
porn organization principle, 
sex, or crash, has no meaning, only use.


time, technology and/or bodies come together
"herkommen"


Modernism, Boomerism marks the total break from herkommen, 
it is shameful to be a monkey,
but not Nazis with manners, 
the quasi-religions of aliens, 
the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality
demons into one masked devil, 
preindividual being "is not one but more than one"

reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork




Materiality (209), 
two machines connected, reader and writer
writing code or language, is action
leads to consequences in the material word
execution, fire code, 
kill real people, drone strike

relations between matter
from material conditions reality,
office workers, 
solutions, 


postmodern not to justify with reason
culmination, circle
neither good or bad
modernism, fashion, now no fashion, monoculturism


ductwork, how can i see this in perl?
things that are different should look different

hammer everything looks like a nail, modernism, not look whats being pounded
focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
perl the submissive butler
programmer, decision maker

not object-oriented


Lucy: always or, never and.




natural /artificial lingo = bs
meaning and authorship remain in question

(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result. T

Larry Wall, perl postmodern language.
modernist culture about 'or' rather than 'and', 
postmodern culture reversed
critical modernist tradtion, emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and 
transparency of production.
Marshall Berman; All that is Solid Melts into Air
dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction
modernity=incomplete project, how can it complete?
postmodernity, deferring, stall
