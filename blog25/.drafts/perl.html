Perl is "free-form language"[learning perl]
perl postmodern language.
My teacher once said, it's like improvisational jazz, 
, Perl slogan: there is more than one way to do it.



schizopathologies, jump from one masked identity to another 
in computing, perl/unix pipes are open, 
transparent? 
hidden, stay home with only your Windows open
transparent is only the user for consumerism.
what is going on, 



functional, rather than outcome
evades scientifc description

Gil: 
body expression of what can not be expressed with 
"natural language"
lack of signifiers,  most direct, less equivocal
like with Gesture? 
mix of body and language

materiality of body code

like poetry, no sense
body, transducer of signs


Learn as you go along with life and your coding project
emphasis on needs and interests of the individual
And thus can lead to a completety different outcome, journey.
invention, broad virtual imagination
romanticism, individual in relation to the absolute (Grant?)

raising responsible person, require to make individual choices,
evaluation for individ and society?
Wall: 
not everyone should agree, but at least disagree
but discuss things, "deconstruction'
add subroutine??


The Modern is a cool, technical apparatus 
of simplicity, reduction
program choice between black-white, 
take sides of good and bad, depending on space.

the greater "precision" of "universal laws",
that "John Doe" can agree on, 
the greater the side effects
reduced to data, 
offending flatness of mass language,
suppression of individual expression leads to violence 


the past-modern refuses to die, 

Liberated learners need context, the bigger picture (Wall)
or 'not doing it', 

the modern society not given, innovation in gray, monoculture
removing diversity, the plague,  
language, control and precision

McKenzie
Ballard, overview
on the global communication infrastructure, 
of motor highways, aeroplane, television
which determines local movement, or non-movement
visible functional ductwork, laid open
psychopathologies
television (fake)
visible




Is the Postmodern, a missed opportunity?
deemed 'uncool', 
cowardly defers solution to kill the modern
focus on endless discussion, 

dialectical thinking, "and-both" over "either-or"
change can't happen, without embracing contradiction,
because of aufheben of difference
modern is the new, but also transitional space
cutting off past and future


Unix culture of sharing seeds, cultivation is your problem.


postmodernism adapts more real world,
offers many possibilities at once,
3D perspective, from space various timelines, interpret into smth new.
mix and grow the plants, for your colourful plot. 
not ready for this, boomer parents


postmodern does not kill anything, 
not in terms of aufheben, like the "modern" museum, 
the cool killer of history, that with its hard links, 
points only to one past.
Naturally digest, poop. growth

What happened, neolib
keeping the poop, not reinterpreting it, 
modern, in den Arsch beissen.
reversed cycle

ductwork=shell scripts /pipes
establish fluid connections, 


critical modernist tradtion, 
emphasize on materiality, reflexivity and transparency of production.




The "virtual world" opposite to the real, 
Fisher asks in his thesis, are we all dead, 
just animated by external forces?
The body, entity consisting of uncountable autonomous parts


Crash
porn organization principle, 
sex, or crash, has no meaning, only use.


time, technology and/or bodies come together
"herkommen"


Modernism, Boomerism marks the total break from herkommen, 
it is shameful to be a monkey,
but not Nazis with manners, 
the quasi-religions of aliens, 
the true violent face of Morals is costumed by mask of morality
demons into one masked devil, 
preindividual being "is not one but more than one"

reinvent everything? or just zudecken

architecture=functional ductwork




Materiality (209), 
two machines connected, reader and writer
writing code or language, is action
leads to consequences in the material word
execution, fire code, 
kill real people, drone strike

relations between matter
from material conditions reality,
office workers, 
solutions, 


postmodern not to justify with reason
culmination, circle
neither good or bad
modernism, fashion, now no fashion, monoculturism


ductwork, how can i see this in perl?
things that are different should look different

hammer everything looks like a nail, modernism, not look whats being pounded
focus not on the problem to be solved, but on the person who tries to solve it
perl the submissive butler
programmer, decision maker

not object-oriented


Lucy: always or, never and.




natural /artificial lingo = bs
meaning and authorship remain in question

(210)
The execution of code engages materiality and imagination through the possible and often unpredictable ac-tions that result. T
