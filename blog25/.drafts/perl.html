<p>"The polemic is not affective garnish but a diagnostic instrument. When a position immunizes itself against reasons, politeness becomes a candid form of complicity." ~ Reza Negarestani</p>

For decades, not to say all my <i>conscious</i> life as a convicted dreamer, 
I am haunted by the ghost of history.
Dressed up in the latest civic fashion, 
he intrusively bangs at my front door and
demands to "buy" his unique bible nihil. 
As expected, I am always taken by surprise, 
but not persuaded by the callousness of this opportunistic 
daytime sleeper, yet, 
the tumultuous moment of astonishment produces a pragmatic fit 
of reactionary mannerism, which is laid out in the brief, 
human attraction to the sensual madness of "How to approach the stint of a madman?".
But not long and a tenacity of life contracts with the strength of all its senses, 
pulling cogito beyond psychology and in sanity, 
which all the same seals a farewell with the subconscious parting will 
on the condition of a lasting big hug and the package "What is psychoanalysis?". 
And lo, what is it, that allows my mind occupied and my body blocked with all that 
repetitive garbage?

because it has referred all its presupposiitions back to the empirical self.'(164, del)

A ghost in broad daylight within the age of reason is a form of dilemma, 
and in particular remarkable as the 
uninvited apparition introduces himself as a proxy of science 
to substantiate his status of a lawful, authoritarian figure in the uncanny valley.
The role of the father empowers to publicly claim 
of having objectively observed the pleasure principle,<small>[1]</small> 
and in doing so, he feeds malnourished bird brains with what they want
and blindly subjects to the indifference of a god, 
which differentiate themselves from difference outside time. 

Unfortunately, civilised 
historical thought 
differentiates in the exterior form of a fixed temporality, 

that renders the eternal, unhistorical, fleeting moment of precise present, 
useless for diagnosis. (animal, cow)

but is

I observe the pleasure principle all the time. gg

pain and pleasure in context with 
past and future are not naturally given, 



swallowed and automatically internalised as one thing, 
and what is not evident, is simply filled with mainstream fantasy, 
and cunningly interprets the unpredictive flapping of a bird 
as the maul of a saurian monster.

necessary to enable change. 

 and thus avoid a painful analysis of human dreck.

trauma, 
actions (repeated actions death drive?)

but what is with internal trauma and memory thought?
soul manages what goes into RAM

unhistorical=everything is permitted for atheist
Ivan, does not act, but onlooker 

if immortal soul is broken, everything is lawful

überhistoric viewpoint (10)
past bad, everything gets better,  
unhistoric dreaming the crimes of the future

überhistorisch, hyperhistoric no change (all is eternal, vielfalt), Glück? (11)

historic and unhistoric bound together

AI disrupts human memory, dissolves human past
ghost

primitive progression of intellect

quality does not present to the human senses(Rene, p 4) 

soul is it a quality, or material substance?
but drastically shows changes in environment, society
(only material, in unison with body, Rene, p.5)

moral conscience, social anxiousness


conscience, past is only accessed by intellect
soul and body, conceived by intellect
HOW entangle, imagination



which notably glistened bright by its absence in his metapsychology. 

rational contemplate the two factors in isolation within the deep plane of time,
instead in sequential succession?

the package depression and relief, changes nothing in the object itself
but the mind that contemplates it

thought, exercise the unaided intellect, study the notion of soul
math, employs imagination (shape and motion), gives us clear notions about the body
union (ordinary life)(end of 5)



AB in depth (we only see changing AB), 
AB1, AB2 , (sequential) frequency gets shorter, AB remains, but why termed
as 1, 2

AB fades (dies), new AB(born) 
(the status of matter as mens momentae), difference introduced
(history repeats itself, because behaviour is expected) 
animal does forget, but not trauma imprisoned

but actually difference in mind

bad feeling, relief



(pressure too strong, then the body resists)

impression causes idea (of the body)



If we interpret symptoms as causes (Reza say)

any intervention on the mind are doomed to fail

generational trauma caught in a loop of catastrophic events 

further wasting valuable energy in the cold economy (economy=cold)


everything not seen before, 
not belongs here, not normal,is unheimlich




Only abstract code (common, shared language) makes bewusstsein possible

cognize one self in the mirror? 

but selbsbewusst, aware of the foreclosure of the real. 


Contrary to general belief, language does not connect, but sets limits, 
in the "artificial" framework perl, the human faces its boundaries. 
self-aware natural /artifical language obsolete, 
as only the matter code matters, human perception are just forms of it. 



Unsplit matter code, from which the animal does not only <i>Herkommen</i>,

the ego , with its unconscious, superego
in a container, produces the isolated subject,

wrap mass-sugery thought into "noble" emotion 
and push the allies body & soul to the front line,

erroneous put in opposition
definable


thus the abject, das verdrängte, also oppossed to I

I have dismiss either as dubious or a trap

Indeed "You have time." 


the embodied abject  

a seed of belief, then disbelief, existance 
to leave me in a state of great doubt , delir

must be brain fever, delirium tremens from alcohol withdrawal
phil is subjective and objective
descartes: presenting Cogito as a definition
soul, pronoun
where is cogito in freud?




Finally a grain of truth
that what the ghost wants, to not believe him (like freud!!)

if you loose faith in me altogether, you will know I exist (madness)


commercial success has proved him right, 
and is the epochal treshold official benchmark, 
which seperates animal from the human. 

What is his business though, to induce 
the notion of economy
circular


"inductive inferences"
generalized
past is observed, 
imagination beyond the observed

suicidal death drive

promise to dream no more in darkness, 
as opium remedy
flash of intellect that eliminates all angels and demons
death to mark a new beginning for "humanity". 


the dogma enlightenment
trust the illusionary senses, 
as in-/extensions of the adversary body
but on the other hand
science exuberant fantasy

billions wasted to solve that mystery
infinite speculations on what lay beyond the pleasure principle

lueften the secret that for sure erroneous

further obscuring the object closely tied to it, 
keeping its mystery safe


The German word <i>Wahrnehmung</i>, in its literal translation as <i>truth intake </i>,

suggests that automated selection processes of body and soul are correct, 

trust inner knowledge, habitual? and this is common for the genus
also jentsch


abstract quality is real not seperated but bound to the object







of the body or the soul?????????
monitor soul interface, pure, the objective judge

then fantasy hineininterpretieren

the spirit fires the soul, moves the body

Descartes:
that "soul moves body", 
quality, not with body moves a body

What appears to the mass as a fundamental tenet to the humanities,
is pathological systems theory

not forgotten darkness??, that's why mass not happy?? past

what have they forgotten? morals of darkness?

Remarkably, economic into his theory (Hume?)

daymarish, 
unhistorical new beginning
a violent break, which revolutionises a peace of mind  
horizons


historical death drive, 
cannot let go nightmarish repulsion, 
to follow his rattling "chain" of thoughts, 
destroys culture


memory, child, what is important whats not
forgetting the past
animal, dementia precox
history is a power

resilience, one anaemic, the other growth
people conscience

the past as nützlich, wird der mensch zum menschen
a history costumed as past, a lackey to utilitarianism



in a moment of mental aberration
space and time shrink, past future?

industrial human exchange of personal culture with mass culture
the pain of loss, opium

a norm mechanical

the more take away culture, the more intensive livestock farming 
for mass produced things, the mass produced human

everything mass produced equals beauty
no beauty in anything nature

my world is a tender matrix, allows to dance 
A book outlining the absolute, a bible so to speak, 
must invite the reader to pause and think,

Vergangenheit leugnen, man siehts ihm an, crooked, um ihren neid zu wecken
es war, is to blame, war, sorrow, 
life not perfect

happyness, is to forget, unhistorical, continous small vs big happyness
siegesgøttin, not stand
nicht vergessen kønnnen, see everwhere only becoming (but if vergessen, then becoming??)
fresh start?? and why live in fear?
is it distinguished between forget and history?
it is poss to live happy without memory, animal
but imposs to live without forgetting 










morals, institutionalized 
corrected

religion substituted by another illusion of nation state(karatani, 33)


unanswered "accursed" questions
rooted in human finitude and wish to transcend it (karatani,33)
religion no answers, science adn nation can fix it

"the church as the state"
prison vs conscience prison
the state ausführen morals by western church, punishment

nation state is utopian enforced society

but if sa is even corrupted?

A environment so bright, senses see all cruel
but reason gone

transcendental illusion=not by senses but reason


foreclosure of the real
structured for "making sense", 


(but makes new electric ones, that one should trust)
transcendental illusion (Kant), is that innert history/trauma


as there are multiple signs of the non-linguistic direct language
to leave me alone, 
my intolerance to artificiality produces a rash on my
skin, visible encrusted scabs allover, 
my spine encumbered from carrying the dead freight of his hypotheses. 

Upright walking I'm wearing the skin of my past, 
nothing to be ashamed of, conscience

what strikes lacks in defining Cogito , "id", society

re-brand of the soul un-German idealism

universal definition of the human, women and primitive are animal








Just like King Laugh, unexpected,

psychoanalytic revolution was nothing but
the mass wants it literally, and Freud provides

the avant-garde of AI generated text,

pathalogical compulsion googly eyes in search for scientific truths,
