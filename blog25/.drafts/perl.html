<p>
At Goldsmiths I was taught, coding in Perl means individual improvisation,
tuning in on the constant negotiation 
of the body and its intrinsic function, 
and not falling for the Standard Error (STDERR) 
of the biological and technological divide. 

The band sets the inhuman digital rythm of our activity, 
free radical vicissitudes all at once, 
which resonate in the archaic body. 

but unison of autonomous software cell that ru(i)ns the wetware of the body


beyond human instinct, 
repressed to engage with chaos 

articulate by modulation of its frequencies, 
Jungle and D'n'B, 


the body is not complex at all,
cyber control through fluidity, worse than hierarchical 
material running by 0 and 1, a pure abstract of sex.


Vulgar vowels and click consonants, 

sound is immediate reproduction in motion, 
distorted echoes of past,

It is not wrong to view body as a functional medium, 
information

senses are dismembered from the body, 
phenomenon of ASMR, "satisfaction" arousal from watching videos
human instinct
the less knowledge the more insecurity, hostility, 
xenophopia towards the body and technology.



Crash technology is the extension of death, writes Baudrillard,
which is beckoning from a dimension of depth, 
accessed through the body, in the irrationality of petit mort and dream.




replacement of most intimate sensation

of what we want not want we need, more capital

Kittler writes, articulate code, or disappear under it completely(kittler, 40)

a circumcised penis, glans always open, freed from foreskin, 
organs orbiting the calcified, constrictive nervous system, 
and susceptible to biological impulse rather than
mere sensation. 


not necessarily rot, since death becomes commodity, 
keeping the comatose alive.

posthuman, a simulation of human mind
transhuman, body modification to live longer

body, ruler 
neither backlash of the flesh, as in tech fascism (neoX, transhumanism)
or agree to everything what the authorians say (roko)





Azuma defines cyberspace, cyberpunk author Gibson, 
imagined cyberspace as analogue, which one logs in and out
in truth, 

cyberspace cannot invade  the body, 
what looks like the invasion of alien technology into the carnal, 
is its homeland, ruled independent from the mind. 


instead the mind is captured in the screen, 
immersed in the 3D game,
biological trap of
oversaturated environment, 
which according to psychology, 
is favoured by depressed and vision=impaired souls, 
 gray monoculture. 


Ballard gives hope, 
The electronic highway is alive, emanicpatory for the mind.

AGI destroys culture

In Perl, with warn(), taking action is always too late, 
as it runs the code anyway, internal compiler preemptively simulate the run.(16, perl)
the ()die function, stops it, "getting out of a program earlier than normal"(152)
and thus protects from

Death is the end of the world is a local event, 
and everyone (image/simulation) is dying with you. 




Crash is positive feedback,
break free from the negative cybernetic loop, 
where life is conditioned by death 



the physical state = mental state.
not private, but belongs to the whole body (universe)

God does not exist, but exists failures in reality

no compassion, 
but let people physically experience their mental state, 
abstract computing to intervene with the material world.
"abstraction to intervene with real life" (goeffey)

where does pain come from , inside outside?

physical and emotional pain seem to be absent in Crash,

a painful experience does collapse the convenient distinction between the mind and body"
(suspension Stelarc suggests, 132)?

Why would anyone using computers, if we really fear the Crash?<small>[1]</small>
</pre>

At first blush, the novice might regard <i>Crash</i>,
despite its weirdness, as the most boring program Ballard has written, 

but do fuck around and find out, that this short software 
is one of the most interesting and virulent works of science fiction [SF].<small>[2]</small>

the elegant, terse capture 
of the complex postmodern condition.
by computing a database of homoerotic lewdness 
and technological landscapes 
in a pornographic loop of violence. 


Sonntag, Porn, in contrast to serious literature, has only one intention, 
arousal of sense, 
and Ballard makes use of this strategy, 
 to avoid the deflection of the mind of complex story
provokes a radical empiricism, and points directly 
perversion of information consumer society. 

somewhat lacks narrative, 
Corny porn begins with clumsy encounters, very popular is a crash 
of two distinct <i>character classes</i><small>[]</small>
which without foreplay, 
straight enact gender-specific sexual intercourse.



Crash, according to Perl philsophy "no unnecessary limits"(perl, 41)
in terms of endless possibilites of interpretation.

a priori human knowledge is one of them.(58, Roden) 
(schon vorher wissen), what it's all about. 

Deleuze, (221)
pre-quantitiave and pre-qualitative dramatization, 
makes possible sufficient reason (and carries potentiallity in the idea)
maybe similar with Artaud, 


J.G. Ballard, what role plays in this a menage a trois,
psychopatholgy differentiates himself by writing, 

dialectical idea of unfuckable, narrator James Ballard 
who can live
without his  aesthetic better half, cool robot Catherine
two-way interaction, emotional pain of detachment when relationship ends,
exchange of body fluids, or meaningless genetic information.

his aesthetic actualization
is possessed by its alter ego Vaughn, 
, who displays most morbid of behaviour,
who he is anally penetrating


death drive, finally obsolete body dies?


Cronenberg made a feature-length postmodern fusion
between glossy advertisment and documentary on contemporary cybernetic culture
in cool blue hue. 

although laid open in front of our eyes

cannot unsee the increased traffic after the Crash, 
as if awakened from machinic unlife??
although his obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
makes him of traversing the 
hellish non-spaces of airports, motorways and reservoirs, 
to reduce his anxiety accident

whilst the capital Pandemonium, 
tirelessly rearranges human circulation, 
transportation system for meltdown culture.

invest time to sculpt their hardbodies, 
and place great effort to appear as model avatars on the screen, 
interchangable as not different, 
to impress the like-minded, zombies rotten from the inside.  

immidiate gratifcation is the goal of progress,
unbearable intensities of continual cuming and crashing, 


What do they produce? 
stressed from making phone calls and rearrange data

degenerete predators, who give up and sell knowledge,
