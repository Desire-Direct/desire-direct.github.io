Feuchter Forst, springtime, 2025

<p>
Only just when walking Lucy, the eerie crept upon me.
The first notable dogging activity, 
usually announced to the animal with "Are we going to the beach?", 
is romping around the outlandish zone,
where sturdy grass and thistles grow on sand,
displaying the imprints from former excursions, 
only to be washed away by emerging pools of contaminated piss.

Viviparous froth and interiors from tailless amphibians laid open,
blending with 
susceptible fauna rotting away in sleazoid puddles of mucilaginous concistency, 


the stable constants of habitual decay and production of slime,
in which inanimate 
mirror neurons simulate the actions of 
tireless molecule, 
to 
new identities without membranes
a sonic algorithm.

The plodding on uncommon, soft terrain, 
grubbing around in messy land,                      

in stateless fluid and solid, 
dimensional creep, visceral
al-chemia


the drive of burrowing holes to mould the solid into flowing meaning, 
otherwise the solid, remains a matter of Everything.


in the heat of the moment, 
spirit of research
neglecting the creation of a <b>mound</b>


Holes, on the other hand, deemed Nothing without 
the firm boundaries of the solid.<small>referring to the notes of Dr. Parsani.</small>

Some personalities are significantly psyched 
by freshening the feet in overturning water,

which provide limitless work for the inquisitorial, sensitive nose.
exactly here, the science of chemistry is born

intense in this alleged sandbox of innocent foolery,

which in truth, is a outermost critical laboratory, 
where the movement of a grain of sand, changes everything.


the philosophical thinking of nature
practice, not just specualtions from the desk of the physist.



Lucy, however, was playing surprisingly cool until we moved on, 
all of a sudden, her insecurities discharged in protective spasm, 
provoking a throwing up of overfilling sensations in warm yellow bile. 
Was my performance that bad?

She seemed fine, so in content peace, we were carried off by the enchanted forest, 
welcoming us in its safe humid womb,
fleeing from the glaring light, emanating from spring sun.
rays like a spider web.

Her, being all jazzed up, muckraking in branchage, moss and soil,
Me, with lofty spirit, taking in the cool and damp exhalation of the woods, 
a similitude in awareness of life,
difference
unaware of she was tracking and triumph
ferreting a fresh hoof of an ungulate.

In a glimpse, my consciousness was shattered, 
a sudden jolt punched my guts, is striking through my bones,  
intrusion of the Real, 
feeling trust my eyes, 
which is typically repressed by social tolerable

And although my mind logically draws the connection 
to terrors inflicted by a most violent beast of prey, 
I am unable to form a relation, 


between what I perceive, seeing and a shakened body, 
which is abjection, conflation of sense and affect, 
meaning collapses, 
and the weird takes over, 
as the hoof were haunted, 
more like unexplicable phenomenon of deja-vu.
and obviously, she is a person, der gar nichts unheimlich ist.


</p>

<p>
Her little eyes glowing with desire for the inanimate object of intensity,
and Lucy is by no means shameful of crunching away the certainty of death.

She proudly holds on to it, defending the rare treasure, 
within the boundaries of the muzzle,
which is fastened by Sittlichkeit from the outside,
whilst Sitte presses unremittingly from the inside.

Haunted by the wolf, a ghost from the past, 
who is whispering there is no need to show obediance towards the former.

Their common totem, the abandoned relic, 
orginal abstract of small packs, 
which is gained through sophisticated hunt technology,
but incorporated by gifted magic, 
which has the powers to draw the former into.(129, golem)
and is taboo.

Breaking the law in the thin air of Sittlichkeit is emancipatory, 
but freeing oneself from 
Sitte requires the harsh punishment 
and the cast out and live among humans.


<i>Morgenr&ouml;te</i> is all about propriety, 
explains Nietzsche, 

Sitte implicates both customs and morals,
but basically, it is a legal name for "das Herkommen".

The quasi-religions of aliens, 
costumed Sitte as Sittlichkeit,

masked devil, 

prohibition the inevitability for transgression 
for the alive, the dead. 

not only prying beyond a world full of truths, 
but judge the unpronouncable, 
betraying the unwritten rules of animal
behaviour, which is communicated in vulgar vowels only.

destruction of the small real, thru infinite phantasms

Once civilized, now primitive cultures
gained understanding in memorizing
the effects of cause

understand how to act, begreifen
or assess (dem instinkt
with lack fear and compulsion
cybernetic Nietzsche, demands to controll success


No, herkömmliche art zu handeln und abzuschätzen.? consequences


replaced by the construct of right-wing concept of family,
which add nothing new to the orginal, just change the original (as in colonization)


Freud does not understand taboo, 
which is a concrete whole centre, 
not an arrow with negative tendencies to the forbidden,
private/public, 
more than the personal, 
touching taboo, consequence punishment


if the group is well, the indivdual is well
aborigines, not only survive in a most hostile environment, 
but thrive through the drive of their good nose.

Contrary to Terror management theory (TMT), 
which states that terror arises, by merely thinking about it. 
all human activity is driven by the fear of death,

or, better fear of life.


Kant's kategorischer Imperativ, motivation for action,
survival, food and sex, avoiding death
majority is happy with.
ablehnung von "bewusster motivation"?
mensch als zweck

Universal laws, like a rising sun is a matter of course, given,
but actually for the majority the sun does not shine anymore, acknowledge?
emotional blunting towards the wonders,
or questioning why, the earth is responsible, 
but are we grateful?



But what alarming development of the situation!
Now it is me, that desperately wants it, 
a irresistable urge to closely examine it is originating from the possessed object,
which even commands me to touch it.

act would be regarded as unsittlich, Pfui!

coz I am also not Bückling to herkommen.
I am herkommen
just follow its orders.
without evaluation, if it is useful
for progress
Huntsmen also no shame?


to be fair, we both share the ability find the uncommon. 

What use would it have for me, other than its  possession??
what are the reasons that founded Herkommen?


But I in contrast to Lucy, show no signs of interest in the
brutally severed, splintered bone in Elfenbein, 
something, what she regards as food. 
no trace of blood, violence, that signifies death

In a continous struggle,
and thank god, gag order, protected me from the powerful jaws
of the otherwise kind and gentle beast, trust
Finally, I hold it, the inanimate furry body part,
quite close, but yet remains alien,
dangling limply, 
the two divided toes of an Artiodactyla, covered with keratin,
exactly this element what is assimilated, which I want to claim for myself.
as strange as me, and normally inconceivable
, grown from the inside, moulded by the outside.

Finally, the shame of compromise, 
Lucy, the ManBearPig, back drawn to wolf, and seperate.

noumenal (absolute) sense = unconditional madness. 
</p>


<p>
The I experienced a violent bewilderment, 
without traces of fear,
nor signs of evil,

Nietzsche asks, how the feeling of herkommen is different from fear?(15)
fright from higher intellect, unbegreiflich Macht
Aberglaube in this fright

yea, unheimlich

the body presenting a frank, but for me strange, uncommon
 sight, the rejected aspect of a split personality,
that does not belong to the I,

 that occurs in societies of advanced technology, 
where mediated mutilation is more familiar, 
in form of Wurst and Schweinshaxe.
hiding the terrors
industrial pig farming.







cute deer, 
How can such a tender, jettisoned object, shake me out of myself?
Expeling the I for a fraction of second,
standing beside me, 

eerie emanates from this dismembered hoof, 
Fisher writes, more a fascination with "which lies beyond standard perception"(8),
a fascination, not to be resolved, but overcome.
desire rejects from what, death

and although Obviously must, it does not signify death to me? 
but life.
Nothing signifies death, 
lif and death cant be signified, 
neither blood, nor decay, in/outside???

symbolized

part is severed 
from the  animate body, to which it usually belongs to.





, but still of soul? (leaves example?)

What is abjection? seperated from norms and rules.(is that modern man, cast of from morals?), 
subjective horror (abjection)= Mark?object gives off fear, fear it off.
Mark, Freuds fear of castration, but represses smth even more worse?


repressed corporeal reality.
abject, disturbs social reason
but misogyny, genocide ok, 



I disagree with Mark, who suggests 
because the feeling uncanny, outside logic.(8)?
the "unhomely" (9, literal translation!!!!)
more inproppriate "un" in english?, 


(flatline,4)
or is it more the shock that,
what in familiar perception should be alive, is inanimate now?



Which explains the uncanny valley phenomenon, 
I was falling briefly into the valley, 
exciting the innate fear of death, 
or terrified by Freud's great fear of castration, 

but what is he burying so deep, terror
FEAR has an object, and a subject (I what I fear)(fisher, 5)
but when indistinguishable, 
DEATH


behind the cute mask, hineindenken a human, 
trying to understand
until somewhat almost human, then strong revulsion (zombie)
but then up again.



immoral modern times, 
Morality on the other hand is a mere overgrow decorum of morals 

alien, cold-blooded insect consonants, 
more meaning

chipped toenails, 
the dung, for a weakly, invasive orchid, Bückling towards morals.

always to the sun, decent to do, 
ignoring roots deeper 




 
The sun and its counterpart the black hole, the evil twin. 
Twins in grounded cultures however are seen as a bad omen and will be infanticised. 
Taboo is not about politics, 
The death penalty was executed if one f**** around within the same totem, 
Blutschande on the other hand would be theoretically possible between father and his children, as it is the mother who gives kinship to their children. 
(changed later)


cultural exogamy
Exogamy means letting the outside in.
