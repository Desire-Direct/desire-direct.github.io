Feuchter Forst, springtime, 2025
<p>
Only just when walking Lucy, the eerie crept upon me.

The first notable activity, 
what I announce to as "Are we going to the beach?", 
romping around
where hard gras and thistles grow on sand,
that show imprints from former excursions, 
washed away by pools of overturned water.

from the inquisitorial nose
notable psyched in protective spasm, provoke the 
throwing up overfilling sensations in warm yellow bile. 

Later, we were carried off by the enchanted forest, 
which is welcoming us like heimat, 
fleeing from the glaring light, 
rays like a spider web
emanating from spring sun.

Her being all jazzed up, muckraking in branchage, moss and soil,
I, with lofty head, taking in the cool and damp exhalation of the woods, 
a similitude in awareness of life,
difference
unaware of she was tracking and triumph
ferreting a fresh hoof of an ungulate.

In a glimpse, my subconscious was shattered
a sudden jolt is striking through my bones, punched my guts, 
intrusion of the Real, 
feeling trust my eyes, 
which is typically repressed by social tolerable

although my mind logically draws the connection 
to terrors inflicted by a most violent beast of prey, 
I am unable to form a relation, 
between what I perceive, seeing and a shakened body, 
which is abjection, conflation of sense and affect, 
meaning collapses, 
and the weird takes over, 
as the hoof were haunted, 
more like unexplicable phenomenon of deja-vu.


Her little eyes glowing with desire for the intense object,
by no means shameful of crunching away the certainty of death 
she proudly holds on to it, vindicate the treasure
biting through the boundary of the muzzle,
and obviously, she is a person, der gar nichts unheimlich ist.

But what alarming development of the situation!
Now it is I, that wants it, 
feeling a strong desire to closely examine it, 
to touch it.

So after a short struggle,
and thank god, her muzzle, protected me from the powerful jaws
of the otherwise kind and gentle beast.

I hold it, the inanimate furry body part
quite close, but yet so alien, 
indeed the two divided toes of an Artiodactyla, covered with keratin,
dangling limply, 
exactly this element what is assimilated, which I want to claim for myself.
coz its alien, 
On the other side, no blood,  
I, in contrast to Lucy, show no signs of interest in the
brutally, severed, splintered bone in Elfenbein, 
what she regards as food.

Finally, the shame of compromise, 
Lucy back drawn to wolf, and seperate.

I experienced a violent bewilderment, without traces of fear,
the body presenting a frank, but for me weird
 sight, the rejected aspect of a split personality,
that occurs in societies of advanced technology, 
where mediated mutilation is more familiar.

How can such a tender, jettisoned object, shake me out of myself?
Expeling the I for a fraction of second,
standing beside me, 


eerie emanates from this dismembered hoof, 
Fisher writes, more a fascination with "which lies beyond standard perception"(8),
a fascination, not to be resolved, but overcome.
desire rejects from what, death

and although Obviously must, 
it does not signify death to me? 
Nothing signifies death, 
lif and death cant be signified, 
neither blood, nor decay, in/outside???

symbolized

part is severed 
from the  animate body, to which it usually belongs to.





, but still of soul? (leaves example?)

What is abjection? seperated from norms and rules.(is that modern man, cast of from morals?), 
subjective horror (abjection)= Mark?object gives off fear, fear it off.
Mark, Freuds fear of castration, but represses smth even more worse?


repressed corporeal reality.
abject, disturbs social reason
but misogyny, genocide ok, 



I disagree with Mark, who suggests 
because the feeling uncanny, outside logic.(8)?
the "unhomely" (9, literal translation!!!!)
more inproppriate "un" in english?, 


(flatline,4)
or is it more the shock that,
what in familiar perception should be alive, is inanimate now?



Which explains the uncanny valley phenomenon, 
I was falling briefly into the valley, 
exciting the innate fear of death, 
or terrified by Freud's great fear of castration, 

but what is he burying so deep, terror
FEAR has an object, and a subject (I what I fear)(fisher, 5)
but when indistinguishable, 
DEATH


behind the cute mask, hineindenken a human, 
trying to understand
until somewhat almost human, then strong revulsion (zombie)
but then up again.
