After a longer break, I'm getting back into electroniX, 
<a href="https://desire-direct.com/images/555-moon02.jpg">once again</a> 
making use of the 555 timer IC (integrated circuit), 
with the intention to further my philosophical inquiries across time 
and, as of yet, Gothic Materialism through anti-praxis. 
For more convienent power supply, I've soldered jumper wires to a spare USB cable, 
which fires the breadboard with 5V, sufficient for smaller test circuits 
like this one.

The 555 apparently<small>[1]</small> runs free in a/stable mode, transformed into a multivibrator, 
for a generation of switching pulses, 
that is hauntingly oscillating between the two states of high and low.

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is the control system of the operative,
enabled through rewiring and its postmodern operatic technique (POT),  
which oddly enough, remains invisible to the human eye,<small>[2]</small> 
although the material condition of the world has dramatically changed. 

Duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal determine the vibe, 
however, if the signal stays 100% HIGH, frequency is omitted [measured in hertz(Hz)]
and the modern duty cycle is never completed,
giving rise to the banal, yet evil, posthuman flatline construct of 
a permanent light emitting diode.


<h5>recap on some of the components used:</h5>
the Diode is a one-way street and allows current to flow only in one directon. 
quick pole identification without a multimeter (in :diode mode):
LED: long leg is anode (+), 
the rim of the bulbous body is oblate at the cathode end (-);
indicated by a black band in the <b>1N4148</b>;<br>
&nbsp;the ceramic capacitor is non-polarized and ideal for high-frequency circuits;

I am well prepared for the morrow, and looking forward with glee
to build up on, and visualize aquired knowledge as previously <a href="https://github.com/the-vtex-files/the-vtex-files.github.io/blob/master/images/transformer.gif">accomplished with state-of-the-art radar technologies</a>.

<p>Notes</p>
[1] Despite common misconception, 555 signals are never analogous, but consistently digital.<br>
[2] the counter tactics of radical empiricism will be revealed in a forthcoming post.
